</h6>
<p>Suppose \(T(z) = (az+b)/(cz+d)\) is a Möbius transformation that fixes 0 and \(\infty\text{.}\) In this case, the form of the Möbius transformation can be simplified. In particular, since \(T(0) = 0\text{,}\) it follows that \(b=0\text{.}\) And since \(T(\infty)=\infty\text{,}\) it follows that \(c = 0\text{.}\) Thus, \(T(z) = \frac{a}{d}z\) which may be written as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
T(z) = re^{i\theta}z.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>With \(T\) in this form, it is clear that if \(T\) fixes 0 and \(\infty\text{,}\) then \(T\) is a combination of a dilation (by factor \(r\)) and a rotation about the origin (by a factor \(\theta\)). We may assume that \(r &gt; 0\) in the above equation, because if it is negative, we can turn it into a positive constant by adding \(\pi\) to the angle of rotation.</p>
<p>A dilation by \(r\) will push points along lines through the origin. These lines are precisely the type I clines of 0 and \(\infty\text{.}\) All points in the plane either head toward \(\infty\) (if \(r &gt; 1\)) or they all head toward 0 (if \(0 \lt  r \lt  1\)).  Of course, if \(r = 1\) there is no dilation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, rotation about 0 by \(\theta\) pushes points along circles centered at the origin. These circles are precisely the type II clines of 0 and \(\infty\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section3-5.html#ex_mobfix0inf">in-context</a></span>
