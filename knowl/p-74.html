<p>Under reasonable assumptions about space, hyperbolic, elliptic, and Euclidean geometry are the only three possibilities for the global geometry of our universe. Researchers have spent significant time poring over cosmological data in hopes of deciding which geometry is ours. Deducing the geometry of the universe can tell us much about the shape of the universe and perhaps whether it is finite. If the universe is elliptic, then it must be finite in volume. If it is Euclidean or hyperbolic, then it can be either finite or infinite. Moreover, each geometry type corresponds to a class of possible shapes. And, if that isn't exciting enough, the overall geometry of the universe may be fundamentally connected to the fate of the universe. Clearly there is no more grand application of geometry than to the fate of the universe!</p>
