<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Recall the journey in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_block.html" title="Example 5.4.17: Hyperbolic squares?">Example 5.4.17</a> in which a bug travels a path that would trace a square in the Euclidean plane.  For convenience, we assume the starting point \(p\) is such that the first right turn of \(90^\circ\) occurs at the point \(x\) on the positive real axis and the second turn occurs at the origin.  (This means that \(x = (e^a-1)/(e^a+1)\text{.}\))  The third corner must then occur at \(xi\text{.}\)  We have reproduced the journey with some more detail in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-hmk-hyp3leftturns.html" title="Figure 5.4.25">Figure 5.4.25</a>.  In this exercise we make use of hyperbolic triangle trig to measure some features of this journey from \(p\) to \(q\) in terms of the length \(a\) of each leg.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Determine the hyperbolic distance between \(p\) and the origin (corner two of the journey).  In particular, show that \(\cosh(d_H(0,p)) = \cosh^2(a)\text{.}\)  Note that if this journey had been done in the Euclidean plane, the corresponding distance would be \(\sqrt{2}a\text{.}\)  How do these distances compare for small positive values of \(a\text{?}\)  Is \(\cosh^2(a)\) close to \(\cosh(\sqrt{2}a)\text{?}\)</li>
<li>Let \(\theta = \angle x0p\text{.}\)  Show that \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cosh(a)}\text{.}\)  What is the corresponding angle if this journey is done in the Euclidean plane?  What does \(\theta\) approach as \(a \to 0^+\text{?}\)</li>
<li>Show that \(\angle x0p = \angle 0px\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Show that \(\cosh(d_H(p,q)) = \cosh^4(a)[1-\sin(2\theta)]+\sin(2\theta)\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Let \(\alpha = \angle q p 0\text{,}\) \(b = d_H(0,p)\) and \(c = d_H(p,q)\text{.}\)  Show that<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\sin(\alpha) =  \frac{\sinh(b)}{\sinh(c)}\cos(2\theta).
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>Determine the area of the pentagon enclosed by the journey if, after reaching \(q\) we return to \(p\) along the geodesic.  In particular, show that the area of this pentagon equals \(\frac{3\pi}{2}-2(\theta+\alpha)\text{.}\) What is the corresponding area if the journey had been done in the Euclidean plane?</li>
<li>Would any of these measurements change if we began at a different point in the hyperbolic plane and/or headed off in a different direction initially than the ones in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-hmk-hyp3leftturns.html" title="Figure 5.4.25">Figure 5.4.25</a>?</li>
