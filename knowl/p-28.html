<p>Consider a flat, two-dimensional rectangle. In fact, visualize a tablet screen. Now imagine that you are playing a video game called Asteroids. As you shoot the asteroids and move your ship around the screen, you find that if you go off the top of the screen your ship reappears on the bottom; and if you go off the screen to the left you reappear on the right. In <a knowl="./knowl/fig-asteroids.html" title="Figure 1.1.2">Figure 1.1.2</a> there are just five asteroids. One has partially moved off the top of the screen and reappeared below, while a second is half way off the right hand “edge” and is reappearing to the left.</p>
