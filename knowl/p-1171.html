<p>A two-dimensional bug living in the hyperbolic plane, the projective plane, or the Euclidean plane would notice that a small circle's circumference is related to its radius by the Euclidean formula \(c \approx 2\pi r\text{.}\) In Euclidean geometry this formula applies to all circles, but in the non-Euclidean cases, the observant bug might notice in large circles a significant difference between the actual circumference of a circle and the circumference predicted by \(c = 2\pi r\text{.}\) Large circles about a cup-shaped point with positive curvature will have circumference less than that predicted by Euclidean geometry. This fact explains why a large chunk of orange peel fractures if pressed flat onto a table. Large circles drawn around a saddle-shaped point with negative curvature will have circumference greater than that predicted by the Euclidean formula.</p>
