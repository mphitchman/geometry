<span class="type">Example</span> <span class="codenumber">1.3.9</span> <span class="title">A non-Euclidean surface</span>
</h6>
<p>Consider the surface obtained by identifying the edges of the hexagon as indicated in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-hexasteroids.html" title="Figure 1.3.8">Figure 1.3.8</a>. In particular, the edges are matched according to their labels and arrow orientation. So, if a ship flies off the hexagonal screen at a spot on the edge marked \(a\text{,}\) say, then it reappears at the matching spot on the other edge marked \(a\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Suppose the pilot of a ship wants to fly around one of the corners of the hexagon. If she begins at point \(H\text{,}\) say, and flies counterclockwise around the upper right corner as indicated in the diagram, she would fly off the screen at the top near the start of an \(a\) edge.  So, as she made her journey, she would reappear in the lower left corner near the start of the other \(a\) edge. Continuing around she would complete her journey after circling this second corner.</p>
<p>However, the angle of each corner is 120\(^\circ\text{,}\) and gluing them together will create a cone point, as pictured below. Similarly, she would find that the other corners of the hexagon meet in groups of two, creating two additional cone points.  As with the Coneland <a knowl="./knowl/hmk_coneland.html" title="Checkpoint 1.3.5: Coneland">Exercise 1.3.5</a>, the pilot can distinguish a corner point from an interior point here. She can look at triangles: a triangle containing one of the cone points will have angle sum greater than 180\(^\circ\text{;}\) any other triangle will have angle sum equal to 180\(^\circ\text{.}\)</p>

<p>So the surface is not homogeneous, <em class="emphasis">if it is drawn in the plane</em>. However, the surface does <em class="emphasis">admit</em> a homogeneous geometry. We can get rid of the cone points if we can increase each corner angle of the hexagon to 180\(^\circ\text{.}\) Then, two corners would come together to form a perfect 360\(^\circ\) patch about the point.</p>
<p>But how can we increase the corner angles? Put the hexagon on the sphere! Imagine stretching the hexagon onto the northern hemisphere of a sphere (see <a knowl="./knowl/fig-astsphere.html" title="Figure 1.3.10">Figure 1.3.10</a>). In this case we can think of the 6 points of our hexagon as lying on the equator. Then each corner angle <em class="emphasis">is</em> 180\(^\circ\text{,}\) each edge is still a line (geodesic), and when we glue the edges, each pair of corner angles adds up to exactly 360\(^\circ\text{,}\) so the surface is homogeneous. The homogeneous geometry of this surface is the geometry of the sphere (elliptic geometry), not the geometry of the plane (Euclidean geometry).</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section1-3.html#ex_p2surface">in-context</a></span>
