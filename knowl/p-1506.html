<p>The 3-sphere has interesting features, often accessible by analogy with the 2-sphere. If you slice the 2-sphere with a plane in \(\mathbb{R}^3\text{,}\) the intersection is a circle (or a single point if the plane is tangent to the 2-sphere). Moreover, the circle of intersection is a geodesic on the 2-sphere if it is a great circle: a circle of maximum radius drawn on the 2-sphere. Bumped up a dimension, if you “slice” the 3-sphere with \(\mathbb{R}^3\text{,}\) the intersection is a 2-sphere (or a single point if the slice is tangent to \(\mathbb{S}^3\)). Moreover, the 2-sphere of intersection is a great 2-sphere if it is a 2-sphere of maximum diameter drawn in \(\mathbb{S}^3\text{.}\) The boundary 2-sphere common to both solid balls in the figure is a great 2-sphere of \(\mathbb{S}^3\text{.}\)</p>
