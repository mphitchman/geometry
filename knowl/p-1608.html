<p>So if the mass-energy density is about 1/3 of what is required to get us to a Euclidean universe, but it appears from the CMB that the universe is Euclidean, or nearly so, some other form of energy must exist. Evidence for this was presented in 1999 (see, for instance, Â <a knowl="./knowl/cosmictriangle.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 18: The Cosmic Triangle: Revealing the State of the Universe">[18]</a>) in the form of observations of distant exploding stars called Type Ia supernovae. These distant supernovea are fainter than expected for a universe whose expansion rate is slowing down, suggesting that the universe is accelerating its expansion.  In 2011, Saul Perlmutter, Brian Schmidt, and Adam Riess won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on this discovery.</p>
