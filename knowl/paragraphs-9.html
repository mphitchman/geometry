<p>If \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) are surfaces, the <dfn class="terminology">connected sum</dfn> surface, denoted \(X_1 \#
X_2\text{,}\) is obtained as follows: </p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Remove an open 2-ball from \(X_1\) and an open 2-ball from \(X_2\text{;}\)</li>
<li>Connect the boundaries of these open 2-ball with a cylinder.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that since \(X_i\) is a surface, each point in each space has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open 2-ball, so we may always achieve the connected sum of two surfaces. The result is a new surface: it is still closed, bounded, and connected, and each point still has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open 2-ball.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section7-5.html#paragraphs-9">in-context</a></span>
