<p>This map tries very hard to be a homeomorphism. The map is continuous, onto, and it is almost one-to-one with a continuous inverse. It fails in this endeavor only where we join the left and right edges: the points \((0,y)\) and \((1,y)\) in \(\mathbb{I}^2\) both get sent by \(p\) to the point \((1,0,y)\text{.}\) But \(p\) is nice enough to <em class="emphasis">induce</em> a homeomorphism between the cylinder and a modified version of the domain \(\mathbb{I}^2\text{,}\) obtained by “dividing out” of \(\mathbb{I}^2\) the mapping redundancies so that the result is one-to-one. The new version of \(\mathbb{I}^2\) is called a quotient space. We develop quotient spaces in this section because all surfaces and candidate three-dimensional universes can be viewed as quotient spaces. We need the notion of an equivalence relation on a set. To get this, we need the notion of a relation.</p>
