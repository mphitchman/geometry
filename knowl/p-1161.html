<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">However, one must be careful when measuring the shortest path between points in the projective plane. If \(p\) and \(q\) are two points in \(\mathbb{P}^2\) then there is exactly one elliptic line through them both, but we may view this line as consisting of two elliptic segments, both of which connect \(p\) to \(q\text{.}\) That is, if a bug finds herself at point \(p\) and wants to walk along an elliptic line to point \(q\text{,}\) she can do so by proceeding in either direction along the line, as shown in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-ellline.html" title="Figure 6.3.3">FigureÂ 6.3.3</a>. The <dfn class="terminology">elliptic distance between \(p\) and \(q\)</dfn>, which we denote by \(d_S(p,q)\text{,}\) is then the minimum value of the two segment lengths.</p>
