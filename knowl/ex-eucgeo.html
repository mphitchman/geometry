<p><dfn class="terminology">Euclidean geometry</dfn> is the geometry \((\mathbb{C}, \cal{E})\text{,}\) where \(\cal{E}\) consists of all transformations of the form \(T(z) = e^{i\theta}z + b\text{,}\) where \(\theta\) is a real number and \(b\) is in \(\mathbb{C}\text{.}\) Note that \(\cal E\) consists of precisely those general linear transformations of the form \(T(z) = az+b\) in which \(|a| = 1\text{.}\) In the exercises, you check that this collection is indeed a group of transformations.</p>
<p>The group \(\cal{E}\) includes rotations and translations, but not dilations. Let's take a look at some familiar properties of objects that should be invariant in Euclidean geometry.</p>
<p>The <dfn class="terminology">Euclidean distance</dfn> between two points \(z_1\) and \(z_2\) is defined to be \(|z_1
- z_2|\text{.}\) To show that this is an invariant function of \((\mathbb{C},
\cal{E})\text{,}\) we need to show that for any \(T\) in the group \(\cal E\text{,}\) the distance between \(z_1\) and \(z_2\) equals the distance between \(T(z_1)\) and \(T(z_2)\text{:}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
|T(z_1) - T(z_2)| \amp = |(e^{i\theta}z_1 + b)-(e^{i\theta}z_2 + b)|\\
\amp = |e^{i\theta}(z_1 - z_2)|\\
\amp = |e^{i\theta}||z_1 - z_2|\\
\amp = |z_1 - z_2|. \tag{since $|e^{i\theta}|=1$}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Thus, Euclidean distance is preserved in \((\mathbb{C}, \cal{E})\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Angles are preserved as well.   We have already proved that general linear transformations preserve angles (<a knowl="./knowl/thm_gltconformal.html" title="Theorem 3.1.12">TheoremÂ 3.1.12</a>), and Euclidean transformations are general linear transformations, so angles are preserved in \((\mathbb{C}, \cal{E})\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section4-1.html#ex-eucgeo">in-context</a></span>
