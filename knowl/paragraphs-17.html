<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Elliptic Geometry in three dimensions</span></h5>
<p>Three-dimensional elliptic geometry is derived from the geometry that the 3-sphere \(\mathbb{S}^3\) inherits as a subspace of the Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^4\text{.}\) The 3-sphere consists of all points in 4-dimensional space one unit from the origin:</p>
\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{S}^3 = \{(x,y,z,w) \in \mathbb{R}^4~|~ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1\}.
\end{equation*}
<p>Great circles in \(\mathbb{S}^3\) are circles of maximum diameter drawn in the space. Great circles correspond to geodesics in the space. Similarly, a great 2-sphere in \(\mathbb{S}^3\) is a 2-sphere of maximum diameter drawn in the space. As a subspace of \(\mathbb{S}^3\text{,}\) a great 2-sphere inherits the elliptic geometry of Chapter 6. The 3-sphere is discussed in more detail in <a knowl="./knowl/ex_3sphere.html" knowl-id="xref-ex_3sphere" alt="Example 8.1.4 The 3-sphere" title="Example 8.1.4 The 3-sphere">ExampleÂ 4</a>.</p>
<p>The transformation group for elliptic geometry in three dimensions is conveniently described by viewing \(\mathbb{R}^4\) as the set of quaternions. A <em class="terminology">quaternion</em> has the form \(a +
b\textbf{i} + c\textbf{j}+ d\textbf{k}\) where \(a, b, c, d\) are real numbers and \(\textbf{i}, \textbf{j},\) and \(\textbf{k}\) are imaginary numbers with the feature that \(\textbf{i}^2 = \textbf{j}^2 = \textbf{k}^2 = -1\) and the additional property that the product \(\textbf{ijk} = -1\text{.}\) The constant \(a\) is called the <em class="terminology">scalar term</em> of the quaternion \(q = a +
b\textbf{i} + c\textbf{j}+ d\textbf{k}\text{.}\) The <em class="terminology">modulus</em> of \(q\) is \(|q|=\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2}\text{.}\) A quaternion \(q\) is called a <em class="terminology">unit quaternion</em>, if \(|q| = 1\text{.}\) The <em class="terminology">conjugate</em> of \(q\text{,}\) denoted \(q^*\text{,}\) is the quaternion \(q^* = a - b\textbf{i} - c\textbf{j} - d\textbf{k}\text{.}\) One can check that \(q \cdot q^* = |q|^2\text{.}\) The 3-sphere then consists of all unit quaternions.</p>
<p>The transformation group for the geometry on \(\mathbb{S}^3\) is generated by multiplication on the left and/or right by unit quaternions. For fixed unit quaternions \(u\) and \(v\text{,}\) the map \(T:\mathbb{S}^3 \to \mathbb{S}^3\) by \(T(q) = u q v\) is a typical transformation in three-dimensional elliptic geometry. These transformations preserve antipodal points on the 3-sphere - distinct points on \(\mathbb{S}^3\) that are on the same Euclidean line through the origin in \(\mathbb{R}^4\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section8-1.html#paragraphs-17">in-context</a></span>
