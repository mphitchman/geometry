<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>The result was stated for lines in <a knowl="./knowl/th_refconformal.html" title="Theorem 3.1.19">Theorem 3.1.19</a>.  Here we assume \(C\) is a circle of inversion. Consider two curves \(\boldsymbol{r_1}\) and \(\boldsymbol{r_2}\) that intersect at a point \(z\) that is not on \(C\) or at the center of \(C\text{.}\) Recall, \(\angle(\boldsymbol{r_1},\boldsymbol{r_2}) =
\angle(L_1,L_2)\) where \(L_i\) is the line tangent to curve \(\boldsymbol{r_i}\) at \(z\text{,}\) for \(i = 1,2\text{.}\) We may describe this angle with two circles \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) tangent to the tangent lines \(L_1\) and \(L_2\text{,}\) respectively, with the additional feature that the circles meet the circle of inversion \(C\) at right angles, as in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-invconf.html" title="Figure 3.2.11">Figure 3.2.11</a>. Indeed, \(C_1\) is the circle through \(z\) and \(z^*\) whose center is at the intersection of lines \(m_1\) and \(k\text{,}\) where \(m_1\) is the line through \(z\) that is perpendicular to \(L_1\text{,}\) and \(k\) is the perpendicular bisector of segment \(zz^*\text{.}\) Circle \(C_2\) also goes through \(z\) and \(z^*\text{,}\) and its center is on the intersection of \(k\) and the line \(m_2\) through \(z\) that is perpendicular to \(L_2\text{.}\)</p>
<figure class="figure-like"><img src="images/im-invconf.svg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span> <span class="codenumber">3.2.11</span> Inversion in a circle preserves angle magnitudes.</figcaption></figure><p>The advantage to describing \(\angle(L_1,L_2)\) with these circles is that the image of the angle, \(\angle(i_C(L_1),i_C(L_2))\text{,}\) is also described by these two circles, at their other intersection point \(z^*\text{.}\) Notice that these angles will have opposite signs. For instance, in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-invconf.html" title="Figure 3.2.11">Figure 3.2.11</a>, our initial angle is negative, described by sweeping arc \(C_1\) clockwise onto \(C_2\text{,}\) but in the image, we sweep \(i_C(C_1)\) counterclockwise onto \(i_C(C_2)\text{.}\) We leave it as an exercise for the reader to check that the angle of intersection of \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) at \(z^*\) is the same magnitude as the angle between \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) at \(z\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Now we show that inversion preserves angle magnitudes for angles that occur on the circle \(C\) (i.e., \(z\) is on \(C\)). Let \(C^\prime\) be a concentric circle to \(C\text{.}\) Then \(i_C(z) =
S\circ i_{C^\prime}\) where \(S\) is a dilation of \(\mathbb{C}\) whose fixed point is the common center of circles \(C\) and \(C^\prime\) (see <a knowl="./knowl/hmk_invpresmag.html" title="Exercise 3.2.12">Exercise 3.2.12</a>). Since our angle is not on circle \(C^\prime\text{,}\) \(i_{C^\prime}\) preserves the magnitude of the angle by reason of the preceding argument. The dilation \(S\) preserves angles according to <a knowl="./knowl/thm_gltconformal.html" title="Theorem 3.1.12">Theorem 3.1.12</a>. Thus \(i_C\) preserves angle magnitudes as well. We leave the case of the angle occurring at the origin to the next section. Bearing that exception in mind, this completes the proof.</p></article></body>
