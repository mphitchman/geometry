In the figure we have extended squares from each leg of the triangle, and labeled various corners.  We have also constructed the line through \(C\) parallel to \(AD\text{,}\) and let \(L\) and \(M\) denote the points of intersection of this line with \(AB\) and \(DE\text{,}\) respectively. One can check that \(\Delta KAB\) is congruent to \(\Delta CAD\text{.}\)  Moreover, the area of \(\Delta KAB \) is one half the area of the square \(AH\text{.}\)  This is the case because they have equal base (segment \(KA\)) and equal altitude (segment \(AC\)).  By a similar argument, the area of \(\Delta DAC\) is one half the area of the parallelogram \(AM\text{.}\)  This means that square \(AH\) and parallelogram \(AM\) have equal areas, the value of which is \(b^2\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">One may proceed as above to argue that the areas of square \(BG\) and parallelogram \(BM\) are also equal, with value \(a^2\text{.}\)  Since the area of square \(BD\text{,}\) which equals \(c^2\text{,}\) is the sum of the two parallelogram areas, it follows that \(a^2+b^2 = c^2.\)</p></article></body>
