<p>The method of cosmic crystallography has limitations beyond the obvious challenge of accurately measuring astronomical distances. As you will see in the exercises, different shapes might produce identical spikes, so finding a spike in a PSH doesn't precisely determine the shape of our universe (though it would certainly narrow down the list of candidates). All ten Euclidean 3-manifolds will reveal a spike (or spikes) in the PSH if we can see far enough to detect the finite dimensions. Some of the elliptic 3-manifolds will produce spikes in the PSH, but no hyperbolic 3-manifold would reveal itself by this method, since hyperbolic isometries are not Clifford translations.</p>
