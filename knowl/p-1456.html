<p>If the space \(M\) has a metric and our group of homeomorphisms is sufficiently nice, then the resulting orbit space inherits a metric from the universal covering space \(M\text{.}\) To be sufficiently nice, we first need our homeomorphisms to be isometries. The group of isometries must also be fixed-point free and properly discontinuous. The group \(G\) is <dfn class="terminology">fixed-point free</dfn> if each isometry in \(G\) (other than the identity map) has no fixed points. The group \(G\) is <dfn class="terminology">properly discontinuous</dfn> if every \(x\) in \(X\) has an open 2-ball \(U_x\) about it whose images under all isometries in \(G\) are pairwise disjoint. The interested reader is encouraged to see <a knowl="./knowl/stillwell.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 10: Geometry on Surfaces">[10]</a> or <a knowl="./knowl/sieradski.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 9: An Introduction to Topology and Homotopy">[9]</a> for more detail. If our group \(G\) is a fixed-point free, properly discontinuous group of isometries, then the resulting orbit space inherits a metric from \(M\text{.}\)</p>
