<p>Consider the horizontal translation \(T_1(z) = z + 1\) of \(\mathbb{C}\text{.}\) This transformation is a (Euclidean) isometry of \(\mathbb{C}\) and it <em class="emphasis">generates</em> a group of isometries of \(\mathbb{C}\) as follows. Put \(T_1\) and \(T_1^{-1}\) in the group, along with any number of compositions of these transformations. Fortunately, any number of compositions of these two maps results in an isometry that is easy to write down. Any finite composition of copies of \(T_1\) and \(T_1^{-1}\) indicates a series of instructions for a point \(z\text{:}\) at each step in the long composition \(z\) moves either one unit to the left if we apply \(T_1^{-1}\) or one unit to the right if we apply \(T_1\text{.}\) In the end, \(z\) has moved horizontally by some integer amount. That is, any such composition can be written as \(T_n(z) = z + n\) for some integer \(n\text{.}\) We let \(\langle T_1 \rangle\) denote the group generated by \(T_1\text{,}\) and we have</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\langle T_1 \rangle  = \{T_n(z) = z + n ~|~ n \in \mathbb{Z}\}. 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The orbit of a point \(p\) under this group of isometries is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
[p] = \{p + n ~|~ n \in \mathbb{Z}\}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>A fundamental domain for the orbit space \(\mathbb{C}/\langle T_1 \rangle\) is the vertical strip consisting of all points \(z\) with \(0 \leq \text{Re}(z) \leq 1\text{,}\) as in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-rollcyl.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-rollcyl" alt="Figure 7.7.7 " title="Figure 7.7.7 ">Figure 7.7.7</a>. Every point in \(\mathbb{C}\) is related to a point in this shaded vertical strip. Furthermore, no two points in the interior of the strip are related. By passing to the quotient, we are essentially “rolling” up the plane in to an infinitely tall cylinder.  The rolling up process is described by the map \(p:\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}/\langle T_1 \rangle \) given by \(p(z) = [z]\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section7-7.html#example-72">in-context</a></span>
