<p>Cell division (a) has two vertices, six edges, and four faces. One vertex is in the center of the rectangle, and the other vertex is in the corner (remember, all four corners get identified to a single point). As for the edges, four emanate from the center vertex, and we have two others: the horizontal edge along the boundary of the rectangle (appearing twice), and the vertical edge along the boundary (also appearing twice). Thus, the edges of the rectangle are also edges of the cell division, so the faces in this cell division are triangles, and there are four of them.</p>
