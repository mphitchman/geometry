<p>Suppose a two-dimensional cosmologist believes she lives in a surface of constant curvature (because her universe looks homogeneous and isotropic). If she can deduce the curvature of the universe and its total area, she will know its Euler characteristic. That is, by measuring these geometric properties she can deduce the shape of her universe, or, at worst, narrow down the possibilities to two. If \(\chi\) is 2 or an odd integer then the cosmologist will know the shape of the universe. If \(\chi \lt 2\) is even, her universe will have one of two possible shapes - one shape orientable, the other non-orientable.</p>
