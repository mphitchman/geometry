<p>Observe that \(U(z)=z+d\) pushes points along lines parallel to one another in the direction of \(d\) (as in the right of <a knowl="./knowl/fig-parmap.html" title="Figure 3.5.12">Figure 3.5.12</a>).  All of these parallel lines meet at \(\infty\) and are mutually tangent at this point. The map \(S^{-1}\) takes this system of clines to a system of clines that meet just at \(p\text{,}\) and are tangent to one another at \(p\text{,}\) as pictured. The slope of the single line in this system depends on the value of the constant \(d\text{.}\) In fact, the single line in the system of clines is the line through \(p\) and \(T(\infty)\) (see <a knowl="./knowl/hmk_parmap.html" title="Exercise 3.5.12">Exercise 3.5.12</a> for details).</p>
