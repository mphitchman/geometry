<p>On the other hand, there is no physical obstruction to a two-dimensional explorer making the following journey in the hyperbolic plane:  Starting at a point such as \(p\) in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-hyp3leftturns.html" title="Figure 5.4.16">FigureÂ 5.4.16</a>, head along a line in a certain direction for \(a\) units, turn right (\(90^\circ\)) and proceed in a line for \(a\) more units, then turn right again and proceed in a line \(a\) units, and then turn right one more time and proceed in a line for \(a\) units.  Let \(q\) denote the point at which the explorer arrives at the end of this journey.  In the Euclidean plane, \(q\) will equal \(p\text{,}\) because the journey traces out a square built from line segments.  However, this is not the case in \((\mathbb{D},{\cal H})\) (though if we connect \(p\) and \(q\) with a hyperbolic line we obtain a geodesic pentagon with (at least) three right angles!). In the exercises we investigate the distance between \(p\) and \(q\) as a function of the length \(a\text{.}\)</p>
