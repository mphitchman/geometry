</h6>
<p>Three cell divisions of the torus are pictured below, along with one failed cell division. In each valid cell division, we count the number of faces, edges, and vertices of the cell division. To make an accurate count, one must take the edge identification into account.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/im-T2decomp.svg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p>Cell division (a) has two vertices, six edges, and four faces. One vertex is in the center of the rectangle, and the other vertex is in the corner (remember, all four corners get identified to a single point). As for the edges, four emanate from the center vertex, and we have two others: the horizontal edge along the boundary of the rectangle (appearing twice), and the vertical edge along the boundary (also appearing twice). Thus, the edges of the rectangle are also edges of the cell division, so the faces in this cell division are triangles, and there are four of them.</p>
<p>Cell division (b) has six vertices, eight edges, and two faces. There are four vertices in the interior of the rectangle, one vertex on the horizontal boundary of the rectangle, and one vertex on the vertical boundary. Notice that the corner point of the rectangle is not a vertex of the cell division. To count the edges, observe that four edges form the inner diamond, and one edge leaves each vertex of the diamond, for a total of eight edges. The boundary edges of the rectangle do <em class="emphasis">not</em> form edges in this cell division. Counting faces, we have one inside the diamond and one outside the diamond. Convince yourself that the region outside the diamond makes just one face.</p>
<p>You can check that cell division (c) has one vertex in the center of the rectangle, two edges (one is horizontal, the other is vertical), and one face.</p>
<p>The attempt (d) fails to be a cell division of the torus. Why is this? At first glance, we have four vertices, four edges, and two faces. The trouble here is the “face” outside the inner square. It is not a 2-cell - that is, its interior is not homeomorphic to an open 2-ball. To see this, note that this region contains a loop that does not separate the “face” into two pieces. Can you find such a loop? Since no open 2-ball has this feature, the region in question is not homeomorphic to an open 2-ball.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section7-5.html#ex-cell-div-H1">in-context</a></span>
