<p>The elliptic 3-manifolds have also been classified. There are infinitely many different types, and it turns out they are all orientable. The 3-sphere is the simplest elliptic 3-manifold, and Albert Einstein assumed the universe had this shape when he first solved his equations for general relativity. He found a static, finite, simply connected universe without boundary appealing for aesthetic reasons, and it cleared up some paradoxes in physics that arise in an infinite universe. However, the equations of general relativity only tell us about the local nature of space, and do not fix the global shape of the universe. In 1917, the Dutch astronomer Willem De Sitter (1872-1934)  noticed that Einstein's solutions admitted a another, different global shape: namely three-dimensional elliptic space obtained from the 3-sphere by identifying antipodal points, just as we did in Chapter 6 in the two-dimensional case.</p>
