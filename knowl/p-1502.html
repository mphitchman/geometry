<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Of course, one need not build a surface from a regular polygon. For instance, the torus can be built from any rectangle in the Euclidean plane and it will inherit Euclidean geometry. So while the type of geometry our surface admits <em class="emphasis">is</em> determined, we have some flexibility where certain geometric measurements are concerned. For instance, there is no restriction on the total area of the torus, and the rectangle on which it is formed can have arbitrary length and width dimensions. These dimensions would have a simple, tangible meaning to a two-dimensional bug living in the surface (and might be experimentally determined). Each dimension corresponds to the length of a geodesic path that would return the bug to its starting point. A <dfn class="terminology">closed geodesic path</dfn> in a surface is a path that follows along a straight line (in the underlying geometry) that starts and ends at the same point. <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-geoloop.html" title="Figure 7.6.5">FigureÂ 7.6.5</a> shows three closed geodesic paths, all starting and ending at a point near a bug's house. The length of one path equals the width of the rectangle, the length of another equals the length of the rectangle, and the third follows a path that is longer than the first two.</p>
