<p>Chances are, too, that a constant curvature surface cannot be embedded in three-dimensional space. Only the sphere has this nice feature. In fact, if \(X\) is any surface that lives in \(\mathbb{R}^3\text{,}\) like the handlebody surfaces in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-handlebodies.html" title="Figure 7.5.10">FigureÂ 7.5.10</a>, then it must have at least one point with positive curvature. Why is this? The surface in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) is bounded, so there must be some sphere in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) centered at the origin that contains the entire surface. Shrink this sphere until it just bumps into the surface at some point. The curvature of the surface at this point matches the curvature of the sphere, which is positive.</p>
