<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">First, assume one cline is a line \(L\text{,}\) and the other is a circle \(C\) centered at the point \(z_0\) as pictured in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-symmtwoclines.html" title="Figure 3.2.15">Figure 3.2.15</a>. Let \(L_1\) be the line through \(z_0\) that is perpendicular to \(L\text{,}\) and let \(z_1\) be the point of intersection of \(L\) and \(L_1\text{.}\) Next, construct the circle \(C_1\) having the diameter \(z_0z_1\text{.}\) Circle \(C_1\) intersects circle \(C\) at some point, which we call \(t\text{.}\) Notice that \(\angle z_0 t z_1\) is right, and so the circle \(C_2\) centered at \(z_1\) through \(t\) is orthogonal to \(C\text{.}\) Furthermore, the center of \(C_2\text{,}\) \(z_1\text{,}\) lies on line \(L\text{,}\) so \(C_2\) is orthogonal to \(L\text{.}\) Let \(p\) and \(q\) be the two points at which \(C_2\) intersects \(L_1\text{.}\) By construction, and by using <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_orthcircchar.html" title="Theorem 3.2.8">Theorem 3.2.8</a>, \(p\) and \(q\) are symmetric to both \(C\) and \(L\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Now, suppose \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) are circles that do not intersect. We may first perform an inversion in a circle \(C\) that maps \(C_1\) to a line \(C_1^*\text{,}\) and \(C_2\) to another circle, \(C_2^*\text{,}\) as suggested in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-symmtwoclines2.html" title="Figure 3.2.17">Figure 3.2.17</a> (any circle \(C\) centered on a point of \(C_1\) works). Then by reason of the preceeding argument, there exist two points \(p\) and \(q\) that are symmetric with respect to \(C_1^*\) and \(C_2^*\text{.}\) Since inversion preserves symmetry points, \(i_C(p)\) and \(i_C(q)\) are symmetric with respect to both \(i_C(C_1^*)\) and \(i_C(C_2^*)\text{.}\) But \(i_C(C_1^*) = C_1\) and \(i_C(C_2^*) = C_2\) so we're found two points symmetric to both \(C_1\) and \(C_2\text{.}\) (In fact, we have one exception.  If \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) are concentric circles, this strategy will produce points \(i_C(p)\) and \(i_C(q)\text{,}\) one of which is the center of \(C\text{,}\) and we have not yet extended the notion of inversion to include the center.  We do so in the next section in such a way that the theorem applies to this exceptional case as well.)</p>
