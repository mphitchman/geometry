<p>If a star is relatively close to the Earth, then as the Earth moves in its annual orbit around the Sun, the star will appear to move relative to the backdrop of the more distant stars. In the idealized picture that follows, \(e_1\) and \(e_2\) denote the Earth's position at opposite points of its orbit, and the star \(s\) is orthogonal to the plane of the Earth's orbit. The angle \(p\) is called the <dfn class="terminology">parallax</dfn>, and in a Euclidean universe, \(p\) determines the star's distance from the Sun, \(D\text{,}\) by the equation \(D = d/\tan(p)\text{,}\) where \(d\) is the Earth's distance from the Sun.</p>
