<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Consider again the world of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-asteroids.html" title="Figure 1.1.2">FigureÂ 1.1.2</a>. This world is called a <em class="emphasis">flat torus</em>. At every spot in this world, the pilot of the ship would report flat surroundings (triangle angles add to 180\(^\circ\)). Unlike the donut surface living in three dimensions, the flat torus <em class="emphasis">is</em> homogeneous. Locally, geometry is the same at every point, and thanks to a triangle check, this geometry is Euclidean. But the world as a whole is much different than the Euclidean plane. For instance, if the pilot of the ship has a powerful enough telescope, he'd be able to see the back of his ship. Of course, if the ship had windows just so, he'd be able to see the back of his head. The flat torus is a finite, Euclidean two-dimensional world without any boundary.</p>
