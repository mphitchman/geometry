<p>The lens spaces \(L(p,q)\) form an infinite family of elliptic 3-manifolds. Assume \(p &gt; q\) are positive integers whose largest common factor is 1. The lens spaces may be defined as follows. Consider the unit solid ball living in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) whose boundary is the unit 2-sphere. The ball consists of all points \((x,y,z)\) such that \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq 1\text{.}\) Any point on the boundary 2-sphere can be expressed in coordinates \((z,t)\) where \(z\) is a complex number, \(t\) is real, and \(|z|^2 + t^2 = 1\text{.}\) The <dfn class="terminology">lens space \(L(p,q)\)</dfn>  is obtained from the solid ball by identifying each point \((z,t)\) on the boundary 2-sphere with the point \((e^{(2\pi q/p)i} z,-t)\text{.}\) Note that the north pole of the boundary 2-sphere is \((0,1)\) and it is identified with the south pole \((0,-1)\text{.}\) Any other point \(u\) in the northern hemisphere is identified with a single point in the southern hemisphere. This point is found by reflecting \(u\) across the \(xy\)-plane, then rotating around the \(z\)-axis by \(2\pi q/p\) radians. Each point on the equator is identified with \(p-1\) other points.</p>
