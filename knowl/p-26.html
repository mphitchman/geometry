<p>The infinite plane model of the two-dimensional universe works well enough for most purposes, but cosmologists and mathematicians, who notice that everything within the universe is finite, consider the possibility that the universe itself is finite. Would a finite universe have a boundary? Can it have an edge, a point beyond which one cannot travel? This possibility is unappealing because a boundary point would be physically different from the rest of space. But how can a finite universe have no boundary?</p>
