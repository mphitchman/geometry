<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><em class="emphasis">Circumference vs Radius in Coneland and Saddleland</em>. In addition to triangles, a two-dimensional bug can use circles to screen for different geometries. In particular, a bug can study the relationship between the radius and the circumference of a circle. To make sure we think like the bug, here's how we define a circle on a surface: Given a point \(P\) on the surface, and a real number \(r&gt; 0\text{,}\) the circle centered at \(P\) with radius \(r\) is the set of all points \(r\) units away from \(P\text{,}\) where the distance between two points is the length of the shortest path connecting them (the geodesic).</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Pick your favorite circle in the plane. What is the relationship between the circle's radius and circumference? Is your answer true for <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">any</em> circle in the plane?</li>
<li>Consider the Coneland surface of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/hmk_coneland.html" title="Example 1.3.5: Coneland">Example 1.3.5</a>. Construct a circle centered at the tip of the cone and derive a relationship between its circumference and its radius. Is \(C = 2\pi r\) here? If not, which is true: \(C &gt; 2\pi r\) or \(C \lt  2\pi r\text{?}\)</li>
<li>Consider the Saddleland surface of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/hmk_saddleland.html" title="Example 1.3.7: Saddleland">Example 1.3.7</a>. Construct a circle centered at the tip of the saddle and derive a relationship between its circumference and its radius. Is \(C = 2\pi r\) here? If not, which is true: \(C &gt; 2\pi r\) or \(C \lt  2\pi r\text{?}\)</li>
