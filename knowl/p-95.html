<p>Suppose the pilot of a ship wants to fly around one of the corners of the hexagon. If she begins at point \(H\text{,}\) say, and flies counterclockwise around the upper right corner as indicated in the diagram, she would fly off the screen at the top near the start of an \(a\) edge.  So, as she made her journey, she would reappear in the lower left corner near the start of the other \(a\) edge. Continuing around she would complete her journey after circling this second corner.</p>
