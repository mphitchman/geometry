<p>We emphasize that angles <em class="emphasis">are preserved</em> in MÃ¶bius geometry, which is a good thing. Why is this a good thing? Remember that in the distant past, humanity set out looking for a geometry in which Euclid's first 4 postulates hold true, but the 5th one fails. The 4th postulate states that all right angles equal one another. This means that if Ralph is holding a right angle over in the corner, and Randy is holding one down the block somewhere, we ought to be able to transform one onto the other and see that the angles are the same. Transformations do not change angles.</p>
