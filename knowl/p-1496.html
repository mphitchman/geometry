<p>This flexibility is very useful. Whereas surfaces can be constructed from polygons by identifying their edges in pairs, many 3-manifolds can be constructed from a 3-complex (such as the Platonic solids) by identifying its faces in pairs. A 3-manifold built in this way will admit either Euclidean geometry, hyperbolic geometry, or elliptic geometry depending on how, if at all, the corner angles need to change so that the corners come together to form a perfect patch of three-dimensional space. Now we investigate a few 3-manifolds and the geometry they admit.</p>
