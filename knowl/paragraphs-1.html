<p>An online text is fabulous at linking content, but we emphasize that this text is meant to be read.  It was written to tell a mathematical story. It is not meant to be a collection of theorems and examples to be consulted as a reference.  As such, online readers of this text are encouraged to <em class="emphasis">turn the pages</em> using the “arrow” buttons on the page as opposed to clicking on section links.  Read the content slowly, participate in the examples, and work on the exercises.  Grapple with the ideas, and ask questions.  Feel free to email the author with questions or comments about the material.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="preface.html#paragraphs-1">in-context</a></span>
