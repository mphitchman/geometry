<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Given an arbitrary ideal triangle, it may be rotated about the origin (i.e., with a transformation in \(\cal H\)) so that one of its ideal points is at the point \(1\) on the real axis.  This transformation is denoted by \(T_1\) in the following figure. Next, by a parallel displacement in \(\cal H\) with fixed point \(1\) (see \(T_2\)), map a second ideal point to the point \(-1\) on the real axis. The ideal point that gets sent to \(-1\) is chosen so that the third ideal point has positive imaginary component. Finally, there exists a hyperbolic translation that fixes \(1\) and \(-1\) and sends the third ideal point to the point \(i\text{,}\) indicated as \(T_3\) in the following diagram.  With the composition \(T_3 \circ T_2 \circ T_1\) we see that our arbitrary ideal triangle is congruent to the one with ideal points \(1\text{,}\) \(-1\text{,}\) and \(i\text{.}\)  It follows by the group structure of \(\cal H\) that any two ideal triangles are congruent.</p>
