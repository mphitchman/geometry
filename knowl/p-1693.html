<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If our last scattering surface is small relative to the size of the fundamental domain, as in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-cmbsizes.html" title="Figure 8.3.1">Figure 8.3.1</a>(a), then it will not intersect any of its copies. However, if the last scattering surface is large relative to the size of the fundamental domain, as in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-cmbsizes.html" title="Figure 8.3.1">Figure 8.3.1</a>(b), then it will intersect one or more of its copies. Moreover, adjacent copies of the LSS will intersect in a circle. In this happy case, our last scattering surface will contain circles with matching temperature distributions. Look again at <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-cmbsizes.html" title="Figure 8.3.1">Figure 8.3.1</a>(b). We have three copies of our fundamental domain pictured as well as three copies of the LSS (only one of which is shaded to make the situation less cluttered). Two vertical circles of intersection appear in the figure. From our point of view at the center of the LSS, the two images of the circle will be directly opposite one another in the sky. Since these circles are one and the same, the temperature distribution around the two circles will agree. Therein lies the hope. Scan the temperature distribution in the last scattering surface for matching circles.</p>
