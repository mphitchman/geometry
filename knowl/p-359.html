<p>The result was stated for lines in <a knowl="./knowl/th_refconformal.html" title="Theorem 3.1.19">Theorem 3.1.19</a>.  Here we assume \(C\) is a circle of inversion. Consider two curves \(\boldsymbol{r_1}\) and \(\boldsymbol{r_2}\) that intersect at a point \(z\) that is not on \(C\) or at the center of \(C\text{.}\) Recall, \(\angle(\boldsymbol{r_1},\boldsymbol{r_2}) =
\angle(L_1,L_2)\) where \(L_i\) is the line tangent to curve \(\boldsymbol{r_i}\) at \(z\text{,}\) for \(i = 1,2\text{.}\) We may describe this angle with two circles \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) tangent to the tangent lines \(L_1\) and \(L_2\text{,}\) respectively, with the additional feature that the circles meet the circle of inversion \(C\) at right angles, as in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-invconf.html" title="Figure 3.2.11">Figure 3.2.11</a>. Indeed, \(C_1\) is the circle through \(z\) and \(z^*\) whose center is at the intersection of lines \(m_1\) and \(k\text{,}\) where \(m_1\) is the line through \(z\) that is perpendicular to \(L_1\text{,}\) and \(k\) is the perpendicular bisector of segment \(zz^*\text{.}\) Circle \(C_2\) also goes through \(z\) and \(z^*\text{,}\) and its center is on the intersection of \(k\) and the line \(m_2\) through \(z\) that is perpendicular to \(L_2\text{.}\)</p>
