<p>We may build a regular octagon in the hyperbolic plane whose interior angles equal \(\pi/4\) radians. We may also find a hyperbolic transformation that takes an edge of this octagon to another edge. Labelling the edges as in the following diagram, let \(T_{a}\) be the hyperbolic isometry taking one \(a\) edge to the other, being careful to respect the edge orientations. We construct such a map by composing two hyperbolic reflections about hyperbolic lines: the hyperbolic line containing the first \(a\) edge, and the hyperbolic line \(m\) that bisects the \(b\) edge between the \(a\) edges. Since the two lines of reflection do not intersect, the resulting map in \(\cal H\) is a translation in \({\cal H}\) and has no fixed points in \(\mathbb{D}\) (the fixed points are ideal points).</p>
