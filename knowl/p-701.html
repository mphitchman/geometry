<p>Thus, the first inversion takes \(z_0\) to 0 and \(z_0^*\) to \(\infty\text{.}\) To build \(T\) we must also send \(z_1\) to 1. Note that inversion in circle \(C\) will have sent \(z_1\) to some point \(z_1^\prime\) on the unit circle (since \(\mathbb{S}^1_\infty\) is sent to itself). Now reflect across the line through the origin that bisects angle \(\angle 10z_1^\prime\text{.}\) This sends \(z_1^\prime\) to 1, sends \(\mathbb{D}\) to \(\mathbb{D}\text{,}\) and leaves 0 and \(\infty\) fixed. Composing these two inversions yields a Möbius transformation that sends \(z_0\) to 0, \(z_0^*\) to \(\infty\) and \(z_1\) to 1. Since a Möbius transformation is uniquely determined by the image of three points, this Möbius transformation is \(T\text{.}\)</p>
