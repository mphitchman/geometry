<p>The curvature of a surface (such as the graph of a function \(z =
f(x,y)\)) at a particular point is a measure of how drastically the surface bends away from its tangent plane at the point. There are three fundamental types of curvature. A surface has positive curvature at a point if the surface lives entirely on one side of the tangent plane, at least near the point of interest. The surface has negative curvature at a point if it is saddle-shaped, in the sense that the tangent plane cuts through the surface. Between these two cases is the case of zero curvature. In this case the surface has a line along which the surface agrees with the tangent plane. For instance, a cylinder has zero curvature, as suggested in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-curvature.html" title="Figure 7.1.2">FigureÂ 7.1.2</a>(c).</p>
