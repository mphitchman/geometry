<p>To test for hyperbolic geometry, perhaps the pilot can turn to triangles. The angles of a triangle in the hyperbolic plane sum to less than 180\(^\circ\text{,}\) but only noticeably so for large enough triangles.  In our disk model of hyperbolic geometry, we can easily observe this angle deficiency.  In the figure below, triangle \(\Delta zuw\) has angle sum about \(130^\circ\text{,}\) and \(\Delta pqr\) has angle sum of about \(22^\circ\text{!}\)  Whether an intrepid 2-D explorer could map out such a large triangle depends on how much ground she could cover relative to the size of her universe.  We will have more to say about such things in Chapters 7 and 8.</p>
