<p>Suppose we are located at a point \(z\) in a hyperbolic universe with curvature \(k\text{.}\) We see in the distance a hyperbolic line \(L\) that seems to extend indefinitely. We might intuitively see the point \(w\) on the line that is closest to us, as suggested in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-angleofpar.html" title="Figure 7.3.2">FigureÂ 7.3.2</a>. Now suppose we look down the road a bit to a point \(v\text{.}\) If \(v\) is close to \(w\) the angle \(\angle wzv\) will be close to 0. As \(v\) gets further and further away from \(w\text{,}\) the angle will grow, getting closer and closer to the angle \(\theta = \angle wzu\text{,}\) where \(u\) is an ideal point of the line \(L\text{.}\)</p>
