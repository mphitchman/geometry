<p>If the universe is a 3-torus, and our LSS has diameter larger than some dimension of the 3-torus, then the LSS will intersect copies of itself, and the matching circles would be diametrically opposed to one another on the LSS. Suppose our Dirichlet domain in a 3-torus universe is an \(a\) by \(b\) by \(c\) box in \(\mathbb{R}^3\text{,}\) where \(a \lt  b \lt  c\text{.}\) Our LSS is then centered at the center of the box. The injectivity radius of the universe is \(a/2\text{.}\) In the following figure, we assume that \(r_{obs}\text{,}\) the radius of the LSS, is greater than \(a/2\) but less than \(b/2\text{.}\) In this case, the circles-in-the-sky method would detect one pair of matching circles in the temperature distribution of the LSS. From the Earth \(E\text{,}\) we would observe that circle \(C_1\text{,}\) when traced in the counterclockwise direction, matches circle \(C_2\) when traced in the clockwise direction, with no relative phase shift.</p>
