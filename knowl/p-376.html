<p>Now, suppose \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) are circles that do not intersect. We may first perform an inversion in a circle \(C\) that maps \(C_1\) to a line \(C_1^*\text{,}\) and \(C_2\) to another circle, \(C_2^*\text{,}\) as suggested in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-symmtwoclines2.html" title="Figure 3.2.17">FigureÂ 3.2.17</a> (any circle \(C\) centered on a point of \(C_1\) works). Then by reason of the preceeding argument, there exist two points \(p\) and \(q\) that are symmetric with respect to \(C_1^*\) and \(C_2^*\text{.}\) Since inversion preserves symmetry points, \(i_C(p)\) and \(i_C(q)\) are symmetric with respect to both \(i_C(C_1^*)\) and \(i_C(C_2^*)\text{.}\) But \(i_C(C_1^*) = C_1\) and \(i_C(C_2^*) = C_2\) so we're found two points symmetric to both \(C_1\) and \(C_2\text{.}\)  (In fact, we have one exception.  If \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) are concentric circles, this strategy will produce points \(i_C(p)\) and \(i_C(q)\text{,}\) one of which is the center of \(C\text{,}\) and we have not yet extended the notion of inversion to include the center.  We do so in the next section in such a way that the theorem applies to this exceptional case as well.)</p>
