<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The lens spaces \(L(p,q)\) form an infinite family of elliptic 3-manifolds. Assume \(p &gt; q\) are positive integers whose largest common factor is 1. The lens spaces may be defined as follows. Consider the unit solid ball living in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) whose boundary is the unit 2-sphere. The ball consists of all points \((x,y,z)\) such that \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq 1\text{.}\) Any point on the boundary 2-sphere can be expressed in coordinates \((z,t)\) where \(z\) is a complex number, \(t\) is real, and \(|z|^2 + t^2 = 1\text{.}\) The <dfn class="terminology">lens space \(L(p,q)\)</dfn>  is obtained from the solid ball by identifying each point \((z,t)\) on the boundary 2-sphere with the point \((e^{(2\pi q/p)i} z,-t)\text{.}\) Note that the north pole of the boundary 2-sphere is \((0,1)\) and it is identified with the south pole \((0,-1)\text{.}\) Any other point \(u\) in the northern hemisphere is identified with a single point in the southern hemisphere. This point is found by reflecting \(u\) across the \(xy\)-plane, then rotating around the \(z\)-axis by \(2\pi q/p\) radians. Each point on the equator is identified with \(p-1\) other points.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The lens space \(L(p,q)\) can be obtained from a cell division of the unit solid ball. The cell division has \(p+2\) vertices: the north pole \(n\text{,}\) the south pole \(s\text{,}\) and \(p\) equally spaced vertices along the equator, label them \(v_0, v_1, \cdots, v_{p-1}\text{.}\) The following figure depicts this scene for \(p = 5\text{.}\) There is an edge connecting \(v_i\) to each of its neighbors on the equator, creating \(p\) edges around the equator. There is an edge connecting each \(v_i\) with \(n\) and an edge connecting each \(v_i\) with \(s\text{,}\) as pictured, for a total of \(3p\) edges. The vertices and edges create 2\(p\) triangular faces on the boundary sphere, half of them in the northern hemisphere. The 3-complex has a single 3-cell, corresponding to the interior of the solid ball.</p>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Let \(N_i\) denote the face in the northern hemisphere whose vertices are \(v_i, v_{i+1}, n\text{.}\) Let \(S_i\) be the face in the southern hemisphere whose vertices are \(v_i, v_{i+1}\text{,}\) and \(s\text{.}\) The lens space \(L(p,q)\) is created by identifying face \(N_i\) with face \(S_{i+q}\) where the sum \(i + q\) is taken modulo \(p\text{.}\) For instance, in \(L(5,2)\text{,}\) the shaded face \(N_0\) in the figure is identified with the shaded face \(S_2\) (and the circle of points pictured in \(N_0\) gets sent to the circle of points in \(S_2\)). The faces \(N_1\) and \(S_3\) are identified, as are \(N_2\) with \(S_4\text{,}\) \(N_3\) with \(S_0\) and \(N_4\) with \(S_1\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section8-1.html#ex_lenspace">in-context</a></span>
