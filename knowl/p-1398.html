<p>We have seen that any surface is homeomorphic to a polygonal surface representing \(H_g\) or \(C_g\text{,}\) for some \(g\text{,}\) and we now show that each of these may be given a homogeneous, isotropic and metric geometry (so that it has constant curvature). A polygonal surface can only run into trouble homogeneity-wise where the corners come together. Any point in the interior of the polygon has a nice 360\(^\circ\) patch of space about it, as does any point in the interior of an edge. However, if the angles of the corners that come together at a point do not add up to 360\(^\circ\text{,}\) then the surface has either a cone point or a saddle-point, depending on whether the angle sum is less than or more than 360\(^\circ\text{.}\) As we saw in Chapter 1 (<a knowl="./knowl/hmk_coneland.html" title="Checkpoint 1.3.5: Coneland">Exercises 1.3.5</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/hmk_saddleland.html" title="Checkpoint 1.3.7: Saddleland">Checkpoint 1.3.7</a>), in either case, we will not have a homogeneous geometry; a two-dimensional bug would be able to distinguish (with triangles or circles) a cone point from a flat point from a saddle point.</p>
