<p>The proof of this theorem is left as an exercise, and is essentially the same as the proof that hyperbolic arc-length is an invariant of hyperbolic geometry, from which it follows that area is invariant. One can also prove that the shortest path between two points is along the elliptic line between them.  That is, geodesics follows elliptic lines.</p>
