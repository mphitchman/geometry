<p>Suppose \(C\) is a cline in \(\mathbb{C}^+\) containing antipodal points \(p\) and \(p_a\text{,}\) and suppose \(q\) is any other point on \(C\text{.}\)  We show \(q_a\) is also on \(C\text{.}\)</p>
<p>If \(C\) is a line, it must go through the origin since \(p\) and \(p_a\) are on the same line through the origin.  Since \(q\) and \(q_a\) are also on the same line through the origin, if \(q\) is on \(C\) then \(q_a\) is too.</p>
<p>If \(C\) is a circle, then the origin of the plane is in the interior of \(C\) and the chord \(pp_a\) contains the origin, as pictured in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-intersecting-chords.html" title="Figure 6.1.5">Figure 6.1.5</a>.  The line through \(q\) and the origin intersects \(C\) at another point, say \(w\text{.}\)  We show \(w=q_a\text{.}\)</p>

As antipodal points, \(|p|\cdot|p_a| = 1\text{,}\) and it follows that \(|w|=1/|q|\text{.}\)  Since the segment \(wq\) contains the origin, it follows that \(w\) is the point antipodal to \(q\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section6-1.html#proof-38">in-context</a></span>
