<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We have already seen that the Euler characteristic of the sphere is 2, so the result holds for \(H_0\text{.}\) For \(g \geq 1\) consider the standard polygonal representation of \(H_g\) as a \(4g\)-gon with boundary label \((a_1b_1a_1^{-1}b_1^{-1})\cdots(a_gb_ga_g^{-1}b_g^{-1}).\) One checks that all the corners come together at a single point, so our cell division of \(H_g\) has a single vertex. For instance, consider the 2-holed torus in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-H2corners.html" title="Figure 7.5.24">FigureÂ 7.5.24</a>. Starting at the lower right-hand corner labeled (1), begin traversing the corner point in a clockwise direction. After hitting the \(b_1\) edge near its initial point, one reappears on the other \(b_1\) edge near its initial point. Keep circling the corner (according to the sequence indicated) until you return to the starting point. Notice that all eight corners are traversed before returning to the starting point. So the cell division determined by the polygon will have a single vertex. Since the \(4g\) edges are identified in pairs, the cell division has 2\(g\) edges, and there is one face, the interior of the polygon. Thus, \(\chi(H_g)=1 - 2g + 1 = 2 - 2g\text{.}\)</p>

So the cell division determined by the polygon has one vertex, \(g\) edges, and one face. Thus, \(\chi(C_g)=2-g\text{.}\)</p></article></body>
