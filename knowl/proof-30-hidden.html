<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Consider the case where \(z_0\) is at the origin. The line \(L\) has two ideal points, call them \(u\) and \(v\text{,}\) as in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-hypparallel.html" title="Figure 5.2.7">FigureÂ 5.2.7</a>. Moreover, since \(L\) does not go through the origin, Euclidean segment \(uv\) is not a diameter of the unit circle. Construct one Euclidean line through 0 and \(u\text{,}\) and a second Euclidean line through 0 and \(v\text{.}\) (These lines will be distinct because \(uv\) is not a diameter of the unit circle.) Each of these lines is a hyperbolic line through 0, and each shares exactly one ideal point with \(L\text{.}\) Thus, each is parallel to \(L\text{.}\) The fact that the result holds for general \(z_0\) is left as an exercise.</p></article></body>
