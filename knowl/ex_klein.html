</h6>
<p>The Klein bottle looks a lot like the torus, but there's a twist. The top and bottom edges are identified as they were for the torus, but the left and right edges are oriented oppositely. More formally, it is the polygonal surface obtained from a square with boundary label \(aba^{-1}b\text{,}\) and the Klein bottle is denoted by \(\mathbb{K}^2\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Why is the Klein bottle non-orientable? A bug leaving the screen on the right near the top would reappear on the left near the bottom. But take a closer look, the bug has become mirror-reversed.</p>

<p>This orientation-reversing path exists because of a MÃ¶bius strip lurking in the Klein bottle. (Conisder, for instance, the thin horizontal strip formed by the dashed segments in the figure.)</p>
<p>The same bug living in the torus would never find itself mirror reversed as a result of traveling in its surface. The torus is orientable.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section7-5.html#ex_klein">in-context</a></span>
