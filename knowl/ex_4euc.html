<span class="type">Example</span> <span class="codenumber">8.1.9</span> <span class="title">Four more Euclidean 3-manifolds</span>
</h6>
<p>Two orientable 3-manifolds arise from slight changes to the 3-torus construction of <a knowl="./knowl/ex_3torus.html" title="Example 8.1.2: The 3-torus">Example 8.1.2</a>. The <dfn class="terminology">quarter turn manifold</dfn> results when the front and back faces of a cube are identified with a 90\(^\circ\) rotation, while the remaining 2 pairs of opposite faces are identified directly, as they were for the 3-torus. <a knowl="./knowl/fig-4eucman.html" title="Figure 8.1.10">Figure 8.1.10</a>(a) depicts this identification. The F on the front face is identified with an F on the back face by a one-quarter turn.</p>
<p>The <dfn class="terminology">half turn manifold</dfn> results when the front and back faces of a cube are identified with a 180\(^\circ\) rotation, while the remaining 2 pairs of opposite faces are identified directly, as they were for the 3-torus. See Figure <a knowl="./knowl/fig-4eucman.html" title="Figure 8.1.10">Figure 8.1.10</a>(b).</p>
<p>The remaining two connected, compact, orientable Euclidean 3-manifolds have a hexagonal prism as the fundamental domain. A hexagon can be used to tile the plane, and copies of a hexagonal prism as in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-4eucman.html" title="Figure 8.1.10">Figure 8.1.10</a>(c) can tile \(\mathbb{R}^3\text{.}\) Note that the prism has two hexagonal faces and the other six faces are parallelograms. The <dfn class="terminology">one-third turn manifold</dfn> is obtained as follows: directly identify parallelograms that are opposite one another, and identify the two hexagonal faces with a rotation of 120\(^\circ\text{,}\) as in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-4eucman.html" title="Figure 8.1.10">Figure 8.1.10</a>(c). The <dfn class="terminology">one-sixth turn manifold</dfn> is obtained by identifying the parallelograms as before, but the two hexagonal faces by a rotation of just 60\(^\circ\text{,}\) as in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-4eucman.html" title="Figure 8.1.10">Figure 8.1.10</a>(d). More detailed discussions of these and the non-orientable Euclidean 3-manifolds can be found in <a knowl="./knowl/weeks.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 12: The Shape of Space, 2nd Ed.">[12]</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/adams.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 16: The Shape of the Universe: Ten Possibilities">[16]</a>.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section8-1.html#ex_4euc">in-context</a></span>
