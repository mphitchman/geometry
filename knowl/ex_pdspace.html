</h6>
<p>The <dfn class="terminology">Poincaré dodecahedral space</dfn> has been given consideration as a model for the shape of our universe (see <a knowl="./knowl/nature.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 25: Dodecahedral space topology as an explanation for weak wide-angle temperature correlations in the cosmic microwave background">[25]</a>). Start with a dodecahedron living in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) (we're thinking of it as a solid now, not a surface) and identify opposite faces with a one-tenth clockwise twist (rotation by \(2\pi/10\) radians). It is cumbersome to indicate all face identifications, so the figure below shows the identification of the front face with the back face.  For instance, the two corners labeled with a 1 get matched.Notice: no points in the interior of the dodecahedron get identified.</p>
<p>With this face identification the twenty corners of the dodecahedron come together in five groups of four (one group of 4 is marked with vertices in the figure), and the angles are too small for the corners to create a full open ball of three-dimensional space when they come together. Placing the dodecahedron in elliptic space inflates the corner angles, and we may make these angles fat enough to determine a perfect three-dimensional patch of space.</p>

<p>Extending the ideas of Section 7.7 to this case, one can show that the Poincaré dodecahedral space space is a quotient of the 3-sphere \(\mathbb{S}^3\) by a group of isometries. The dodecahedron pictured here is a fundamental domain of the space. Just as the polygons in Section 7.7 tiled the space in which they lived, and the cubical fundamental domain of the 3-torus tiles \(\mathbb{R}^3\text{,}\) the dodecahedron tiles \(\mathbb{S}^3\text{.}\) Although far from obvious, it turns out that \(\mathbb{S}^3\) is tiled by 120 copies of this dodecahedron!</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section8-1.html#ex_pdspace">in-context</a></span>
