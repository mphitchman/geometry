<p>One may prove that inversion about a sphere \(S\) will send spheres orthogonal to \(S\) to themselves. So, composing two inversions about spheres orthogonal to \(\mathbb{S}^2_\infty\) generates an orientation preserving transformation of hyperbolic three-space \(\mathbb{H}^3\text{.}\) The transformation group consists of all such compositions. Lines in this geometry correspond to arcs of clines in \(\mathbb{H}^3\) that are orthogonal to the sphere at infinity (see line \(L\) in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-h3.html" title="Figure 8.1.1">Figure 8.1.1</a>). These lines are geodesics in \(\mathbb{H}^3\text{.}\) As in the two-dimensional case, Euclidean lines through the origin of \(\mathbb{H}^3\) are also hyperbolic lines. A plane in this geometry corresponds to the portion of a sphere or Euclidean plane inside \(\mathbb{H}^3\) that meets the sphere at infinity at right angles, such as planes \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-h3.html" title="Figure 8.1.1">Figure 8.1.1</a>. If we restrict our attention to any plane in \(\mathbb{H}^3\text{,}\) we recover the two-dimensional hyperbolic geometry of Chapter 5.</p>
