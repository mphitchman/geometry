<p>First, \(z\) gets sent via \(S\) to \(S(z)\text{,}\) which is at the intersection of a line through the origin and a circle centered at the origin. Second, \(U\) (which has the form \(U(z) = re^{i\theta} z\)), sends \(S(z)\) along this line through the origin (by dilation factor \(r\)), and then around a new circle centered at the origin (by rotation factor \(\theta\)) to the point \(U(S(z))\text{.}\) Third, \(S^{-1}\) sends \(U(S(z))\) back to the intersection of a type I cline of \(p\) and \(q\) and a type II cline of \(p\) and \(q\text{.}\) This point of intersection is \(S^{-1}(U(S(z)))\) and is equivalent to \(T(z)\text{.}\)</p>
