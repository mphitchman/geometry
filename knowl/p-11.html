<p>Two longer essays bookend the core content. Chapter 1 introduces the geometric perspective taken in this text. In my experience it is very helpful to spend time discussing this content in class.  The Coneland and Saddleland exercises (<a knowl="./knowl/hmk_coneland.html" title="Checkpoint 1.3.5: Coneland">Exercises 1.3.5</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/hmk_saddleland.html" title="Checkpoint 1.3.7: Saddleland">Checkpoint 1.3.7</a>) have proven particularly helpful for motivating the content of the text. In Chapter 8, after having developed two-dimensional non-Euclidean geometry and the topology of surfaces, we glance meaningfully at the present state of research in cosmic topology. Section 8.1 offers a brief survey of three-dimensional geometry and 3-manifolds, which provide possible shapes of the universe. Sections 8.2 and 8.3 present two research programs in cosmic topology: cosmic crystallography and circles-in-the-sky. Measurements taken and analyzed over the last twenty years have greatly altered the way many cosmologists view the universe, and the text ends with a discussion of our present understanding of the state of the universe.</p>
