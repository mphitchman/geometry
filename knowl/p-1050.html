<p>Consider the closed unit disk, consisting of all complex numbers \(z\) such that \(|z| \leq 1\text{.}\) For each point \(w\) outside this disk, its antipodal point \(w_a\) is inside the disk. Thus, the closed unit disk contains a representative from each pair of antipodal points. However, there is some redundancy: for a point \(w\) on the boundary of the disk \((|w| = 1)\text{,}\) its antipodal point \(w_a\) is also on the boundary. To account for this redundancy, we identify each point on the boundary of the closed unit disk with its antipodal point.</p>
