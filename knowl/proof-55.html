<p>Suppose there is some element \(c\) that is in both \([a]\) and \([b]\text{.}\) We show \([a] = [b]\) by arguing that each set is a subset of the other.</p>
<p>That \([a]\) is a subset of \([b]\text{:}\) Suppose \(x\) is in \([a]\text{.}\) We must show that \(x\) is in \([b]\) as well. Since \(x\) is in \([a]\text{,}\) \(x \sim a\text{.}\) Since \(c\) is in \([a]\) and in \([b]\text{,}\) \(c \sim a\) and \(c \sim b\text{.}\) We may use these facts, along with transitivity and symmetry of the relation, to see that \(x \sim a
\sim c \sim b\text{.}\) That is, \(x\) is in \([b]\text{.}\) Therefore, everything in \([a]\) is also in \([b]\text{.}\)</p>
<p>We may repeat the argument above to show that \([b]\) is a subset \([a]\text{.}\) Thus, if \([a]\) and \([b]\) have any element in common, then they are entirely equal sets, and this completes the proof.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section7-7.html#proof-55">in-context</a></span>
