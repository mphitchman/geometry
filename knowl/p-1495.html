<p>As in the two-dimensional case, three-dimensional Euclidean, hyperbolic, and elliptic geometries are homogenous, isotropic and metric. Furthermore, triangles distinguish the geometries: in Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^3\text{,}\) a triangle has angle sum equal to \(\pi\) radians; in \(\mathbb{S}^3\) any triangle angle sum exceeds \(\pi\) radians; in \(\mathbb{H}^3\) any triangle angle sum is less than \(\pi\) radians. As a result, if we place a solid like a dodecahedron in \(\mathbb{H}^3\) (so that the faces are portions of planes in \(\mathbb{H}^3\)), the angles at which the corners come together are smaller than the corner angles of the Euclidean dodecahedron. These angles shrink further as the corner points of the solid approach ideal points on the sphere at infinity. On the other hand, placing the dodecahedron in \(\mathbb{S}^3\) will increase the angles at the corners.</p>
