<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">With the aid of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-c2isklein.html" title="Figure 7.5.27">Figure 7.5.27</a>, convince yourself that the connected sum of two projective planes is homeomorphic to the Klein bottle as defined in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_klein.html" title="Example 7.5.15: The Klein bottle">Example 7.5.15</a>. At the top of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-c2isklein.html" title="Figure 7.5.27">Figure 7.5.27</a> there are two projective planes (with boundary labels \(a_1a_1\) and \(a_2a_2\)), each with a disk removed. In the connected sum, join the boundaries of the removed disks, which can be achieved by joining the \(s_1\) arcs together and the \(s_2\) arcs together. The \(b\) and \(c\) edges in the first projective plane (and the \(d\) and \(e\) edges in the second projective plane) indicate cuts we will make to the space, portrayed in the subsequent pictures. Thus, by removing a disk from each projective plane, and cutting as indicated by the \(b, c, d\text{,}\) and \(e\) edges, we obtain four rectangles (topologically), all of whose edges get identified as indicated. Convince yourself that by moving these rectangles around (either by rotation, or reflection about a vertical or horizontal axis) we produce the Klein bottle.</p>
