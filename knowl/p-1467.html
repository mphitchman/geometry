<p>Start with a perfectly sized polygon in \(\mathbb{D}\text{.}\) The polygon must have corner angle sum equal to \(2\pi\) radians, and the edges that get identified must have equal length so that an isometry can take one to the other. (In every example so far, we have used regular polygons in which all sides have the same length, but asymmetric polygons will also work.) Next, for each pair of oriented edges to be identified, find a hyperbolic isometry that maps one onto the other (respecting the orientation of the edges). The group generated by these isometries creates a quotient space homeomorphic to the space represented by the polygon, and it inherits hyperbolic geometry. Note also that the initial polygon can be moved by the isometries in the group to tile all of \(\mathbb{D}\) without gaps or overlaps.</p>
