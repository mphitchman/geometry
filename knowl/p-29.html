<p>Thus, the top edge of the rectangle has been identified, point by point, with the bottom edge. In three dimensions one can physically achieve this identification, or gluing, of the edges. In particular, one can bend the rectangle to produce a cylinder, being careful to join only the top and bottom edges together, and not any other points. The left and right edges of the rectangle have now become the left and right circles of the cylinder, which themselves get identified, point by point. Bend the cylinder to achieve this second gluing, and one obtains a donut, also called a torus.</p>
