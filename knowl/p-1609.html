<p>When Einstein first proposed the 3-sphere as the shape of the universe, his theory predicted that the 3-sphere should be expanding or collapsing. The idea of a static universe appealed to him, and he added a constant into his field equations, called the cosmological constant, whose role was to counteract gravity and prevent the universe from collapsing in on itself. But at roughly the same time, Edwin Hubble, Vesto Slipher and others discovered that galaxies in every direction were receding from us. Moreover, galaxies farther away were receding at a faster rate, implying that the universe is expanding. Einstein withdrew his constant.</p>
