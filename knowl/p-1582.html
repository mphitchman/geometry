<p>The CMB radiation coming to us has a temperature that is remarkably uniform: it is constant to a few parts in 100,000, which makes the temperature of the radiation in the LSS very nearly perfectly uniform. As Craig Hogan points out inÂ <a knowl="./knowl/hogan.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 14: The Little Book of the Big Bang">[14]</a>, this is much smoother than a billiard ball. Nonetheless, there are slight variations in the temperature. These variations, due to slight imbalances in the distribution of matter in the early universe, were predicted well before they were finally found (when our instruments became sensitive enough to detect them). These very slight temperature differences might reveal the shape of the universe.</p>
