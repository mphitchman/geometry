<p>However, the angle of each corner is 120\(^\circ\text{,}\) and gluing them together will create a cone point, as pictured below. Similarly, she would find that the other corners of the hexagon meet in groups of two, creating two additional cone points.  As with the Coneland <a knowl="./knowl/hmk_coneland.html" title="Checkpoint 1.3.5: Coneland">ExerciseÂ 1.3.5</a>, the pilot can distinguish a corner point from an interior point here. She can look at triangles: a triangle containing one of the cone points will have angle sum greater than 180\(^\circ\text{;}\) any other triangle will have angle sum equal to 180\(^\circ\text{.}\)</p>
