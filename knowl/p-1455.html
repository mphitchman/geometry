<p>This group contains all possible compositions of these two transformations and their inverses. Thus, the orbit of a point \(z\) consists of all complex numbers to which \(z\) can be sent by moving \(z\) horizontally by some integer multiple of \(a\) units, and vertically by some integer multiple of \(b\) units. An arbitrary transformation in \(\Gamma = \langle T_a,
T_{bi}\rangle\) has the form</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
T(z) = z + (ma + nbi) 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(m\) and \(n\) are integers. A fundamental domain for the orbit space consists of the rectangle with corners \(0, a, a + bi, bi\text{.}\) The resulting quotient space is homeomorphic to the torus. Notice that points on the boundary of this rectangle are identified in pairs. In fact, the fundamental domain, with its boundary point redundancies, corresponds precisely to our polygonal surface representation of the torus.</p>
