<p>Maybe we live in a universe that looks flat (i.e., Euclidean) on smallish scales but is curved globally. This is not so hard to believe. A bug living in a field on the surface of the Earth might reasonably conclude he is living on an infinite plane. The bug cannot sense the fact that his flat, visible world is just a small patch of a curved surface (Earth) living in three-dimensional space. Likewise, our apparently Euclidean three-dimensional universe might be curving in some unseen fourth dimension so that the global geometry of the universe might be non-Euclidean.</p>
