<p>Consider the set \(H = \{R_0, R_{\pi/2}, R_{\pi}, R_{3\pi/2}\}\) consisting of four rotations of \(\mathbb{C}\) about the origin (by 0, \(\pi/2\text{,}\) \(\pi\text{,}\) and \(3\pi/2\) radians).  We observe first that \(H\) forms a group.  Since \(R_0(z)=e^{i0}z = z\text{,}\) \(H\) contains the identity transformation on \(\mathbb{C}\text{.}\)  The set also satisfies closure, and the reader can check all possible compositions.  For instance, \(R_{3\pi/2} \circ R_{\pi} = R_{\pi/2}\text{.}\)  Finally, the inverse of each transformation in \(H\) is again in \(H\text{.}\)  Check that \(R_0^{-1} = R_0\text{,}\) \(R_{\pi/2}^{-1} = R_{3\pi/2}\text{,}\) \(R_\pi^{-1} = R_\pi\text{,}\) and \(R_{3\pi/2}^{-1} = R_{\pi/2}\text{.}\)  Thus, \(H\) is a group and we may study the geometry \((\mathbb{C},H)\text{.}\)  For instance, is the circle \(C\) given by \(|z-i|=.5\) congruent to the circle \(D\) given by \(|z| = .5\text{?}\)  Well, is there a transformation in \(H\) that maps \(C\) onto \(D\text{?}\)  No!  The only four circles congruent to \(C\) are pictured below.  These are found by rotating \(C\) about the origin by 0, \(\pi/2\text{,}\) \(\pi\text{,}\) or \(3\pi/2\) radians, the only allowable transformations in this geometry.</p>
