<p>We may build a regular octagon in the hyperbolic plane whose interior angles equal \(\pi/4\) radians. We may also find a hyperbolic transformation that takes an edge of this octagon to another edge. Labelling the edges as in the following diagram, let \(T_{a}\) be the hyperbolic isometry taking one \(a\) edge to the other, being careful to respect the edge orientations. We construct such a map by composing two hyperbolic reflections about hyperbolic lines: the hyperbolic line containing the first \(a\) edge, and the hyperbolic line \(m\) that bisects the \(b\) edge between the \(a\) edges. Since the two lines of reflection do not intersect, the resulting map in \(\cal H\) is a translation in \({\cal H}\) and has no fixed points in \(\mathbb{D}\) (the fixed points are ideal points).</p>

<p>Define \(T_{b},T_{c}\text{,}\) and \(T_{d}\) similarly and consider the group of isometries of \(\mathbb{D}\) generated by these four maps. This group is a fixed-point free, properly discontinuous group of isometries of \(\mathbb{D}\text{,}\) so the resulting quotient space inherits hyperbolic geometry.</p>
<p>The distance between two points \([u]\) and \([v]\) in the quotient space is given by</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
d_H([u],[v]) = ~\text{min}\{d_H(z,w) ~|~ z \in [u], w \in [v]\}. 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Geodesics in the quotient space are determined by geodesics in the hyperbolic plane \(\mathbb{D}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Topologically, the quotient space is homeomorphic to \(H_2\text{,}\) and the octagon pictured above serves as a fundamental domain of the quotient space. Moving copies of this octagon by isometries in the group produces a tiling of \(\mathbb{D}\) by this octagon. Each copy of the octagon would serve equally well as a fundamental domain for the quotient space. <a knowl="./knowl/fig-cover.html" title="Figure 7.7.12">FigureÂ 7.7.12</a> displays a portion of this tiling, including a geodesic triangle in the fundamental domain, and images of it in neighboring octagons.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section7-7.html#ex_H2">in-context</a></span>
