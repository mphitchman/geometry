<p>Of the 2-manifolds in <a knowl="./knowl/example-2manifolds.html" title="Example 7.5.4: Some 2-manifolds">ExampleÂ 7.5.4</a>, only the third is a surface according to this definition. A set in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is <dfn class="terminology">bounded</dfn> if it lives entirely within some open \(n\)-ball of finite radius. The parallel planes manifold extends infinitely far away from the origin in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) so this manifold is not bounded. This manifold is not connected either.  Informally, a space is connected if it has just one piece. The parallel planes manifold has two distinct pieces (the two planes) that are separated in space, so it is not connected. The open unit disk \(\mathbb{D}\) is bounded and connected, but not closed as a set in \(\mathbb{R}^2\text{.}\) A set \(S\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is <dfn class="terminology">closed</dfn> if it has the following feature: if \(\{z_k\}\) is a sequence of points in \(S\) that converges to a point \(z\text{,}\) then \(z\) is also in \(S\text{.}\)</p>
