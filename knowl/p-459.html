<p>First, invert about any circle centered at \(z_3\text{.}\) This takes \(z_3\) to \(\infty\) as desired. Points \(z_1\) and \(z_2\) no doubt get moved, say to \(z_1^\prime\) and \(z_2^\prime\text{,}\) respectively, neither of which is \(\infty\text{.}\) Second, do a translation that takes \(z_2^\prime\) to 0. Such a translation will keep \(\infty\) fixed, and take \(z_1^\prime\) to some new spot \(z_1^{\prime\prime}\) in \(\mathbb{C}\text{.}\) Third, rotate and dilate about the origin, (which keeps 0 and \(\infty\) fixed) so that \(z_1^{\prime\prime}\) moves to 1. This process yields a composition of inversions that maps \(z_1 \mapsto 1\text{,}\) \(z_2 \mapsto 0\text{,}\) and \(z_3 \mapsto \infty\text{.}\) However, this composition actually involves an <em class="emphasis">odd</em> number of inversions, so it's not a Möbius transformation. To make a Möbius transformation out of this composition, we do one last inversion: reflect across the real axis. This keeps 1, 0, and \(\infty\) fixed. Thus, there <em class="emphasis">is</em> a Möbius transformation taking any three distinct points to the points 1, 0, \(\infty\text{.}\) For now, we let \(T\) denote the Möbius transformation that maps \(z_1 \mapsto 1\text{,}\) \(z_2 \mapsto 0\) and \(z_3 \mapsto \infty\text{.}\)</p>
