<p>Recall that \(\mathbb{R}^3\) is the set of ordered triples of real numbers \((x,y,z)\text{,}\) and a 3-manifold is a space with the feature that every point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open 3-ball. We assume that the shape of the universe at any fixed time is a 3-manifold. Evidence points to a universe that is isotropic and homogeneous on the largest scales. If this is the case, then just as in the two-dimensional case, the universe admits one of three geometries: hyperbolic, elliptic, or Euclidean. This section offers a brief introduction to the three-dimensional versions of these geometries before turning to 3-manifolds. The reader is encouraged to see <a knowl="./knowl/weeks.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 12: The Shape of Space, 2nd Ed.">[12]</a> for a broader intuitive discussion of these ideas, or <a knowl="./knowl/thurston.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 11: Three-Dimensional Geometry and Topology, Vol. I">[11]</a> for a more rigorous approach.</p>
