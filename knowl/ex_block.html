</h6>
<p>Simply put, hyperbolic squares don't exist. In fact, no four-sided figures with four right angles exist, <em class="emphasis">if we assume the sides are hyperbolic segments</em>. If such a figure existed, its angle sum would be 2\(\pi\text{.}\) But such a figure could be divided along a diagonal into two triangles whose total angle sum must then be \(2\pi\) as well. This means that one of the triangles would have angle sum at least \(\pi\text{,}\) which cannot happen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is no physical obstruction to a two-dimensional explorer making the following journey in the hyperbolic plane:  Starting at a point such as \(p\) in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-hyp3leftturns.html" title="Figure 5.4.16">FigureÂ 5.4.16</a>, head along a line in a certain direction for \(a\) units, turn right (\(90^\circ\)) and proceed in a line for \(a\) more units, then turn right again and proceed in a line \(a\) units, and then turn right one more time and proceed in a line for \(a\) units.  Let \(q\) denote the point at which the explorer arrives at the end of this journey.  In the Euclidean plane, \(q\) will equal \(p\text{,}\) because the journey traces out a square built from line segments.  However, this is not the case in \((\mathbb{D},{\cal H})\) (though if we connect \(p\) and \(q\) with a hyperbolic line we obtain a geodesic pentagon with (at least) three right angles!). In the exercises we investigate the distance between \(p\) and \(q\) as a function of the length \(a\text{.}\)</p>
<p>However, we <em class="emphasis">can</em> build a four-sided figure closely resembling a rectangle, if we drop the requirement that the legs be hyperbolic line segments.</p>
<p>Through any point \(0 \lt  a \lt  1\) on the positive real axis, we may construct a hyperbolic line \(L_1\) through \(a\) that is perpendicular to the real axis. Also construct a hyperbolic line \(L_2\) through \(-a\) that is perpendicular to the real axis. Now pick a point \(z\) on \(L_1\) and construct the cline arc \(C_1\) through \(z, 1\) and \(-1\text{.}\) Also construct the cline arc \(C_2\) through \(\overline{z}, 1\) and \(-1\text{.}\) This creates a four sided figure, which we call a <dfn class="terminology">block</dfn>. We claim that each angle in the figure is right, and that opposite sides have equal length. Moreover, \(z\) and \(a\) can be chosen so that all four sides have the same length. This figure isn't a rectangle, however, in the sense that not all four sides are hyperbolic segments. The arcs \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) are not hyperbolic lines.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section5-4.html#ex_block">in-context</a></span>
