<p>The surface \(C_1\) is the projective plane. This space does not embed in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) as the handlebody surfaces do, but it can be represented as a disk with antipodal points identified, as we did in Chapter 6. <a knowl="./knowl/fig-C2.html" title="Figure 7.5.11">Figure 7.5.11</a> depicts the connected sum \(C_1 \# C_1\text{.}\) In <a knowl="./knowl/fig-C2.html" title="Figure 7.5.11">Figure 7.5.11</a>(a), we have removed an open ball from each copy of \(C_1\text{.}\) The boundary circles of these open 2-balls must be joined, and we indicate this by orienting the boundary circles and giving each one the same label of \(c\text{.}\) In <a knowl="./knowl/fig-C2.html" title="Figure 7.5.11">Figure 7.5.11</a>(b), we have sliced open each copy of \(C_1\) at the vertex to which the \(c\) loops are joined. The \(c\) loops are now edges that we identify together in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-C2.html" title="Figure 7.5.11">Figure 7.5.11</a>(c). Thus, we may view \(C_2\) as the square with edge identifications as indicated in part (c) of the figure. It turns out this space \(C_2\) is homeomorphic to the Klein bottle, a famous surface we consider shortly.</p>
