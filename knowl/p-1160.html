<p>The second postulate holds here even though our elliptic space is finite. We can extend line segments indefinitely because the space has no boundary. If we are at a point in the space, and decide to head off in a certain direction along an elliptic straight line, we can walk for as long and far as we want (though we would eventually return to our starting point and continue making laps along the elliptic line).</p>
