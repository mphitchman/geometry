<p>The CMB radiation is coming to us from every direction, and it has all been travelling for the same amount of time - and at the same speed. This means that it has all traveled the same distance to reach us at this moment. Thus, we may think of the CMB radiation that we can detect at this instant as having come from the surface of a giant 2-sphere with us at the sphere's center. This giant 2-sphere is called the <dfn class="terminology">last scattering surface</dfn> (LSS).</p>
