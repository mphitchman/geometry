<p>So we have three different, equally valid geometries that share Euclid's first four postulates, but each has its own parallel postulate. Furthermore, on a small scale, the three geometries all behave similarly. A tiny bug living on the surface of a sphere might reasonably suspect Euclid's fifth postulate holds, given his limited perspective. A tiny bug in the hyperbolic plane would reasonably conclude the same. Small triangles have angles adding up nearly to 180\(^\circ\text{,}\) and small circles have areas and circumferences that are accurately described by the Euclidean formulas \(\pi r^2\) and \(2\pi r\text{.}\) We explore geometry on surfaces in more detail in the next chapter.</p>
