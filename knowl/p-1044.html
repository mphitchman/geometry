<p>The single sign difference between the algebraic desciption of maps in \(\cal S\) from the maps in \(\cal H\) is not a coincidence. We could have defined the transformations in hyperbolic geometry as those Möbius transformations that preserve symmetric points with respect to the unit circle. That is, we <em class="emphasis">could</em> have defined the group \(\cal{H}\) to consist of all Möbius transformations satisfying this property: If \(z \cdot \bar w = 1\) then \(T(z) \cdot \overline{T(w)}
= 1\text{.}\) If we had then asked what such a \(T\) would look like, we would have gone through the argument as we did in this section, with a \(+1\) initially instead of a -1. This sign difference propagates to the sign difference in the final form of the description of the map.</p>
