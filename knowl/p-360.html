<p>The advantage to describing \(\angle(L_1,L_2)\) with these circles is that the image of the angle, \(\angle(i_C(L_1),i_C(L_2))\text{,}\) is also described by these two circles, at their other intersection point \(z^*\text{.}\) Notice that these angles will have opposite signs. For instance, in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-invconf.html" title="Figure 3.2.11">FigureÂ 3.2.11</a>, our initial angle is negative, described by sweeping arc \(C_1\) clockwise onto \(C_2\text{,}\) but in the image, we sweep \(i_C(C_1)\) counterclockwise onto \(i_C(C_2)\text{.}\) We leave it as an exercise for the reader to check that the angle of intersection of \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) at \(z^*\) is the same magnitude as the angle between \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) at \(z\text{.}\)</p>
