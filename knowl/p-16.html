<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">For those familiar with the oringial version of the text published by Jones &amp; Bartlett, we note a few changes in the current edition.  First, the numbering scheme has changed, so Example and Theorem and Figure numbers will not match the old hard copy.  Of course the numbering schemes on the website and the new print options of the text do agree.  Second, several exercises have been added.  In sections with additional exercises, the new ones typically appear at the end of the section.  Finally, Chapter 7 has been reorganized in an effort to place more emphasis on the family \((X_k,G_k)\text{,}\) and the key theorems common to all these geometries.  This family now receives its own section, Section 7.4.  The previous Section 7.4 (Observing Curvature in a Universe) has been folded into Section 7.3.  Finally, the essays in Chapter 8 on cosmic topology and our understanding of the universe have been updated to include research done since the original publication of this text, some of which is due to sharper measurements of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation obtained with the launch of the Planck satellite in 2009.</p>
