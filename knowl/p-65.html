<p>One of the first challenges of non-Euclidean geometry was to determine its logical consistency. By changing Euclid's parallel postulate, was a system created that led to contradictory theorems? In 1868, the Italian mathematician Enrico Beltrami (1835-1900)  showed that the new non-Euclidean geometry could be constructed within the Euclidean plane so that, as long as Euclidean geometry was consistent, non-Euclidean geometry would be consistent as well. Non-Euclidean geometry was thus placed on solid ground.</p>
