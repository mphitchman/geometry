<p>Searches to date have focused on circles that are diametrically opposed to one another on the LSS (or nearly so). This restriction reduces the search space from six parameters to four. Happily, most detectable universe shapes would have matching circles diametrically opposite one another, or nearly so. At the time of this writing, no matching circles have been found, and this negative result places bounds on the size of our universe. For instance, an article written by the people who first realized a small finite universe would imprint itself on the LSSÂ <a knowl="./knowl/cornish.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 19: Constraining the Topology of the Universe">[19]</a>, concludes from the absence of matching circles that the universe has topology scale (i.e., injectivity radius \(r_{inj}\)) bigger than 24 gigaparsecs, which works out to \(24 \times 3.26 \times
10^9 \approx 78\) billion light-years. So, a geodesic closed path trip in the universe would be at least 156 billion light years long.</p>
