<p>Suppose we have right triangle \(ABC\) as in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-Pythag-Thm.html" title="Figure 1.2.2">FigureÂ 1.2.2</a> with right angle at \(C\text{,}\) and side lengths \(a, b\text{,}\) and \(c\text{,}\) opposite corners \(A, B\) and \(C\text{,}\) respectively. In the figure we have extended squares from each leg of the triangle, and labeled various corners.  We have also constructed the line through \(C\) parallel to \(AD\text{,}\) and let \(L\) and \(M\) denote the points of intersection of this line with \(AB\) and \(DE\text{,}\) respectively. One can check that \(\Delta KAB\) is congruent to \(\Delta CAD\text{.}\)  Moreover, the area of \(\Delta KAB \) is one half the area of the square \(AH\text{.}\)  This is the case because they have equal base (segment \(KA\)) and equal altitude (segment \(AC\)).  By a similar argument, the area of \(\Delta DAC\) is one half the area of the parallelogram \(AM\text{.}\)  This means that square \(AH\) and parallelogram \(AM\) have equal areas, the value of which is \(b^2\text{.}\)</p>
