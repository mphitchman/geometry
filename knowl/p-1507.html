<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A surface that admits one of our three geometries will have constant curvature. The reader might have already noticed that the <em class="emphasis">sign</em> of the curvature will equal the sign of the surface's Euler characteristic. Of course the <em class="emphasis">magnitude</em> of the curvature (if \(k \neq 0)\) can vary if we place a polygonal surface in a scaled version of \(\mathbb{P}^2\) or \(\mathbb{D}\text{.}\) That is, while the type of homogeneous geometry a surface admits is determined by its Euler characteristic (which is determined by its shape), the curvature scale can vary if \(k \neq 0\text{.}\) By changing the radius of a sphere, we change its curvature (though it always remains positive). Similarly, the surface \(C_3\) in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-c3hyper.html" title="Figure 7.6.2">FigureÂ 7.6.2</a> has constant curvature -1 if it is placed in the hyperbolic plane of Chapter 5. However, it can just as easily find itself in the hyperbolic plane with curvature \(k = -8\text{.}\) Recall, the hyperbolic plane with curvature \(k \lt  0\) is modeled on the open disk in \(\mathbb{C}\) centered at the origin with radius \(1/\sqrt{|k|}\text{.}\) Placing the hexagonal representation of \(C_3\) into this space so that its corner angle sum is still 2\(\pi\) produces a surface with constant curvature \(k\text{.}\)</p>
