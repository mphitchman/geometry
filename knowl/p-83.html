<p>Getting back to the donut, a two-dimensional bug could use triangles to tell the difference between a “convex” point on an outer wall, and a “saddle-shaped” point on an inner wall (see <a knowl="./knowl/fig-tortriangle.html" title="Figure 1.3.1">Figure 1.3.1</a>). A bug could draw a triangle about the convex point, determine the angle sum, and then move around the surface to a saddle-shaped point, and determine the angle sum of a new triangle (whose legs are the same length as before). The bug would scratch her head at the different angle sums before realizing she'd stumbled upon something big. She'd go home, write up the result, emphasizing the fact that a triangle in the first “convex” region will have angle sum greater than 180\(^\circ\text{,}\) while a triangle in the “saddle-shaped” region will have angle sum less than 180\(^\circ\text{.}\) This happy bug will conclude her donut surface is not homogeneous. She will then sit back and watch the accolades pour in. Perhaps even a Nobel prize. Thus, small triangles and their angles can help a two-dimensional bug distinguish points on a surface.</p>
