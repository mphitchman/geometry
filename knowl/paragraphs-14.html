<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Hyperbolic Geometry in Three Dimensions</span></h5>
<p>The Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry may be extended to three dimensions as follows. Let the space \(\mathbb{H}^3\) consist of all points inside the unit ball in \(\mathbb{R}^3\text{.}\) That is, let</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{H}^3 = \{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 | x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \lt  1 \}. 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The unit 2-sphere \(\mathbb{S}^2\) bounds \(\mathbb{H}^3\text{,}\) and is called the sphere at infinity. Points on the sphere at infinity are called ideal points and are not points in \(\mathbb{H}^3\text{.}\)</p>
<p>The group of transformations for three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry is generated by inversions about spheres that are orthogonal to the sphere at infinity. Inversion about a sphere is defined analogously to inversion in a circle. Suppose \(S\) is a 2-sphere centered at \(\vec v_0\) with radius \(r\text{,}\) and \({\vec v}\) is any point in \(\mathbb{R}^3\text{.}\) Define the point symmetric to \({\vec v}\) with respect to \(S\) to be the point \(\vec{v}_*\) on the ray from \(\vec v_0\) through \(\vec v\) such that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
|{\vec v}-\vec v_0||\vec{v}_*-\vec v_0| = r^2. 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>One may prove that inversion about a sphere \(S\) will send spheres orthogonal to \(S\) to themselves. So, composing two inversions about spheres orthogonal to \(\mathbb{S}^2_\infty\) generates an orientation preserving transformation of hyperbolic three-space \(\mathbb{H}^3\text{.}\) The transformation group consists of all such compositions. Lines in this geometry correspond to arcs of clines in \(\mathbb{H}^3\) that are orthogonal to the sphere at infinity (see line \(L\) in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-h3.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-h3" alt="Figure 8.1.1 " title="Figure 8.1.1 ">Figure 8.1.1</a>). These lines are geodesics in \(\mathbb{H}^3\text{.}\) As in the two-dimensional case, Euclidean lines through the origin of \(\mathbb{H}^3\) are also hyperbolic lines. A plane in this geometry corresponds to the portion of a sphere or Euclidean plane inside \(\mathbb{H}^3\) that meets the sphere at infinity at right angles, such as planes \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-h3.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-h3" alt="Figure 8.1.1 " title="Figure 8.1.1 ">Figure 8.1.1</a>. If we restrict our attention to any plane in \(\mathbb{H}^3\text{,}\) we recover the two-dimensional hyperbolic geometry of Chapter 5.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section8-1.html#paragraphs-14">in-context</a></span>
