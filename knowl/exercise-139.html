<p><em class="emphasis">Another type of block</em>. Consider the four-sided figure \(pqst\) in \((\mathbb{D},{\cal H})\) shown in the following diagram. This figure is determined by two horocycles \(C_1\) and \(C_2\text{,}\) and two hyperbolic lines \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) all sharing the same ideal point. Note that the lines are orthogonal to the horocycles, so that each angle in the four-sided figure is 90\(^\circ\text{.}\)</p>
<p>a. By rotation about the origin if necessary, assume the common ideal point is \(i\) and use the map \(V\) to transfer the figure to the upper half-plane. What does the transferred figure look like in \(\mathbb{U}\text{?}\) Answer parts (b)-(d) by using this transferred version of the figure.</p>
<p>b. Prove that the hyperbolic lengths of sides \(pq\) and \(st\) are equal.</p>
<p>c. Let \(c\) equal the hyperbolic length of the leg \(pt\) along the larger radius horocycle \(C_1\text{,}\) and let \(d\) equal the hyperbolic length of the leg \(sq\) on \(C_2\text{.}\) Show that \(c = e^x d\) where \(x\) is the common length found in part (b).</p>
<p>d. Prove that the area of the four-sided figure is \(c - d\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section5-5.html#exercise-139">in-context</a></span>
