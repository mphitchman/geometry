<p>Assume \(C\) is the cline of inversion, and assume \(p\) and \(q\) are symmetric with respect to a cline \(D\) as in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-invpreservesymm.html" title="Figure 3.2.13">Figure 3.2.13</a> (where \(C\) and \(D\) are represented as circles).</p>
<figure class="figure-like"><img src="images/im-invpreservesymm.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span> <span class="codenumber">3.2.13</span> Inversion preserves symmetry points: If \(p\) and \(q\) are symmetric with respect to \(D\) and we invert about cline \(C\) then the image points are symmetric with respect to the image of \(D\text{.}\)</figcaption></figure><p>We may construct two clines \(E\) and \(F\) that go through \(p\) and \(q\text{.}\) In the figure, cline \(E\) is a circle and cline \(F\) is a line. These clines intersect \(D\) at right angles (<a knowl="./knowl/th_orthcircchar.html" title="Theorem 3.2.8">Theorem 3.2.8</a>). Since inversion preserves clines and angle magnitudes, we know that \(E^*=i_C(E)\) and \(F^*=i_C(F)\) are clines intersecting the cline \(D^*=i_C(D)\) at right angles. Both \(E^*\) and \(F^*\) contain \(p^*=i_C(p)\text{,}\) so they both contain the point symmetric to \(p^*\) with respect to \(D^*\) (<a knowl="./knowl/th_orthcircchar.html" title="Theorem 3.2.8">Theorem 3.2.8</a>), but the only other point common to both \(E^*\) and \(F^*\) is \(q^* = i_C(q)\text{.}\) Thus, \(p^*\) and \(q^*\) are symmetric with respect to \(D^*\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section3-2.html#proof-13">in-context</a></span>
