<p>Consideration of a finite-area universe leads to questions about the type of geometry that applies to the universe.  Let's look at a sphere.  On small scales Euclidean geometry works well enough: small triangles have angle sum essentially equal to 180\(^\circ\text{,}\) which is a defining feature of Euclidean geometry. But on a larger scale, things go awry. A very large triangle drawn on the surface of the sphere has an angle sum far exceeding 180\(^\circ\text{.}\) (By triangle, we mean three points on the surface, together with three paths of shortest distance between the points. We'll discuss this more carefully later.)</p>
