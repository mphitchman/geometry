<p>We note that \(\cal H\) does indeed form a group of transformations, a fact that is worked out in the exercises. Throughout this chapter the unit circle will be called <dfn class="terminology">the circle at infinity</dfn>, denoted by \(\mathbb{S}^1_\infty\text{.}\) Of course, the circle at infinity is not included in the hyperbolic plane \(\mathbb{D}\) but bounds it. The circle at infinity will be used extensively in our investigations. We note here that any MÃ¶bius transformation that sends \(\mathbb{D}\) to itself also sends \(\mathbb{S}^1_\infty\) to itself.</p>
