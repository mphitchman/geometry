<p>Suppose a team of two-dimensional explorers living in \((X_k,G_k)\) tethers one of their team to a line 18 scrambles long (a scramble is the standard unit for measuring length in this world - and 24 scrambles equals one tubablast).  They swing the volunteer around in a circle, and though he laughs maniacally, he is able to record with confidence that he traveled 113.4 scrambles.  Assuming these measurements are correct, which type of geometry applies to their universe?  Can they determine the value of \(k\) from these measurements? If so, what is it?</p>
