<li>Begin with a circular disk with a wedge removed, like a pizza missing a slice or two. Joining the two radial edges produces a cone. Try it with a cone of your own to make sure it works. Now, with the cone flat again, pick three points, labeled \(A\text{,}\) \(B\text{,}\) and \(C\text{,}\) such that \(C\) is on the radial edge. This means that in this flattened version of the cone, point \(C\) actually appears twice: once on each radial edge, as in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-coneland.html" title="Figure 1.3.6">FigureÂ 1.3.6</a>. These two representatives for \(C\) should get identified when you join the radial edges.</li>
<li>Draw the segments connecting the three points. You should get a triangle with the tip of the cone in its interior. (This triangle should actually look like a triangle if you re-form the cone.) If you don't get the tip of the cone on the inside of the triangle, adjust the points accordingly.</li>
<li>With your protractor, carefully measure the angle \(\theta\) subtended by the circular sector. To emphasize \(\theta\)'s role in the shape of the cone, we let \(S(\theta)\) denote the cone surface determined by \(\theta\text{.}\)</li>
<li>With your protractor, carefully measure the three angles of your triangle. The angle at point \(C\) is the sum of the angles formed by the triangle legs and the radial segments. Let \(\Delta\) denote the sum of these three angles.</li>
<li>State a conjecture about the relationship between the angle \(\theta\) and \(\Delta\text{,}\) the sum of the angles of the triangle. Your conjecture can be in the form of an equation. Then prove your conjecture. Hint: if you draw a segment connecting the 2 copies of point \(C\text{,}\) what is the angle sum of the quadrilateral \(ABCC\text{?}\)</li>
