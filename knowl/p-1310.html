<p>Suppose an intrepid team of two-dimensional explorers sets out to determine which 2-dimensional geometry is theirs. Their cosmologists have told them there world is homogeneous, isotropic, and metric, so they believe that the geometry of their universe is modeled by \((X_k,G_k)\) for some real number \(k\text{.}\) They carefully measure the angles and area of a triangle. They find the angles to be 29.2438\(^\circ\text{,}\) 73.4526\(^\circ\text{,}\) and 77.2886\(^\circ\text{,}\) and the area is 8.81 km\(^2\text{.}\) Which geometry is theirs? What is the curvature of their universe?</p>
