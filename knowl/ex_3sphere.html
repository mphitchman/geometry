<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></p>
<p>Recall, the 3-sphere consists of all points in 4-dimensional space 1 unit from the origin:</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{S}^3 = \{(x,y,z,w) ~|~ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">One model of \(\mathbb{S}^3\) consists of two solid balls in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) whose boundary 2-spheres are identified point for point, as in the following figure.  The figure shows a path from point \(a\) to point \(b\) in \(\mathbb{S}^3\) that goes through the point \(p\) on the boundary of the left-hand solid ball before entering the right-hand solid ball through the point on its boundary with which \(p\) has been identified (also called \(p\)).</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:12.5%;margin-right:12.5%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/im-3sphere.svg" role="img" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The 3-sphere has interesting features, often accessible by analogy with the 2-sphere. If you slice the 2-sphere with a plane in \(\mathbb{R}^3\text{,}\) the intersection is a circle (or a single point if the plane is tangent to the 2-sphere). Moreover, the circle of intersection is a geodesic on the 2-sphere if it is a great circle: a circle of maximum radius drawn on the 2-sphere. Bumped up a dimension, if you “slice” the 3-sphere with \(\mathbb{R}^3\text{,}\) the intersection is a 2-sphere (or a single point if the slice is tangent to \(\mathbb{S}^3\)). Moreover, the 2-sphere of intersection is a great 2-sphere if it is a 2-sphere of maximum diameter drawn in \(\mathbb{S}^3\text{.}\) The boundary 2-sphere common to both solid balls in the figure is a great 2-sphere of \(\mathbb{S}^3\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">One may also view \(\mathbb{S}^3\) by stereographically projecting it into the space obtained from \(\mathbb{R}^3\) by adding a point at \(\infty\text{,}\) much as we identified \(\mathbb{S}^2\) with the extended plane via stereographic projection in Section 3.3. Let \(\widehat{\mathbb{R}^3}\) denote real 3-space with a point at infinity attached to it. To construct the stereographic projection map, it is convenient to first express \(\mathbb{R}^3\) in terms of pure quaternions. A <dfn class="terminology">pure quaternion</dfn> is a quaternion \(q\) whose scalar term is 0. That is, a pure quaternion has the form \(q = b\textbf{i} + c\textbf{j} + d\textbf{k}\text{.}\) The point \((x,y,z)\) in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) is identified with the pure quaternion \(q = x\textbf{i} + y\textbf{j} + z \textbf{k}.\)</p>
<p>Though we are working in four-dimensional space, <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-stpro.html" title="Figure 3.3.4">Figure 3.3.4</a> serves as a guide in the construction of the stereographic projection map. Let \(N = (0,0,0,1)\) be the north pole on \(\mathbb{S}^3\text{.}\) If \(P = (a,b,c,d)\) is any point on \(\mathbb{S}^3\) other than \(N\text{,}\) construct the Euclidean line through \(N\) and \(P\text{.}\) This line has parametric form</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
{\cal L}(t)= \langle 0,0,0,1\rangle + t\langle a,b,c,d-1\rangle\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We define the image of \(P\) under stereographic projection to be the intersection of this line with the three-dimensional subspace consisting of all points \((x,y,z,0)\) in \(\mathbb{R}^4\text{.}\) This intersection occurs when \(1 + t(d-1) = 0\text{,}\) or when</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
t = \frac{1}{1-d}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Then the stereographic projection map \(\phi:\mathbb{S}^3 \to \widehat{\mathbb{R}^3}\) is given by</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\phi((a,b,c,d)) =
\begin{cases}\frac{a}{1-d}\textbf{i}+\frac{b}{1-d}\textbf{j}+\frac{c}{1-d}\textbf{k} \amp  \text{ if \(d \neq 1\); }  \\
\infty \amp  \text{ if  \(d=1\). } 
\end{cases} 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In this way, we can transfer the geometry of the 3-sphere into real 3-space with a point at infinity attached to it. For instance, if \(P = (a,b,c,d)\) is on the 3-sphere, its antipodal point is \(-P = (-a,-b,-c,-d)\) and one can show (in the exercises) that these points get mapped by \(\phi\) to points in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) (pure quaternions) \(q = \phi(P)\) and \(u = \phi(-P)\) with the property that \(q \cdot u^* = -1\text{.}\) As a result, two points \(q\) and \(u\) in \(\widehat{\mathbb{R}^3}\) are called antipodal points if they satisfy the equation \(q \cdot u^* = -1\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section8-1.html#ex_3sphere">in-context</a></span>
