<p>In fact, if we suppose for a minute that we can see as far as we wish, then we would be able to see \(G\) by looking in any direction that produces a line of sight with rational slope. In reality, we can't see forever, and this limitation produces a visual boundary. We will let \(r_{obs}\) denote the distance to which we can see, which is the radius of our observable universe. To have any hope of seeing multiple images of the same object, the diameter of our observable universe, \(2r_{obs}\text{,}\) must exceed some length dimension of the universe.</p>
