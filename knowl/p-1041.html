<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/hmk_elliptic2inv.html" title="Exercise 3.5.8">Exercise 3.5.8</a> we showed that any elliptic Möbius transformation is the composition of two inversions about clines that intersect at the two fixed points. In the case of a Möbius transformation that preserves antipodal points, these two fixed points must be antipodal to each other. It follows by <a knowl="./knowl/lemma_antpts.html" title="Lemma 6.1.4">Lemma 6.1.4</a> that the two clines of inversion are great circles in \(\mathbb{C}^+\text{.}\)  Thus, we may view each transformation of \(\cal S\) as the composition of two inversions about great circles.  This is reassuring. By <a knowl="./knowl/th_reflectsphere.html" title="Theorem 6.1.6">Theorem 6.1.6</a>, these inversions correspond to reflections of the sphere about great circles, and composing two of these reflections of the sphere yields a rotation of the sphere. The transformation group \(\cal S\text{,}\) then, consists of Möbius transformations that correspond via stereographic projection to rotations of the sphere.  We summarize these facts below.</p>
