<p>I owe my colleagues at The College of Idaho and the University of Oregon a debt of gratitude for helping to facilitate a sabbatical during which an earlier incarnation of this text developed and was subsequently published in 2009 with Jones  &amp; Bartlett.  Richard Koch discussed some of its content with me, and Jim Dull patiently discussed astrophysics and cosmology with me at a moment's notice.</p>
