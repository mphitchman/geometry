<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Second, the shortest path between two points is the hyperbolic line between them, so light would travel along these hyperbolic lines, assuming light follows geodesics. The pilot's line of sight would follow along these lines, and the ship would move along these lines to fly as quickly as possible from \(p\) to \(q\text{,}\) assuming no pesky asteroid fields block the path. To observe a galaxy at point \(q\) from the point \(p\) (as in the diagram below), the pilot would point a telescope in the direction of line \(L\text{,}\) the line along which the light from the galaxy travels to reach the telescope.</p>
