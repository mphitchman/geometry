<p>We can think of this space as the closed unit disk with its two edges (top-half circle and bottom-half circle) identified according to the arrows in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-p2.html" title="Figure 6.2.7">Figure 6.2.7</a>.  Notice the pleasant journey a bug has taken from \(p\) to \(q\) in this figure.  From \(p\) she heads off toward point \(c\text{,}\) which appears on the boundary of our model.  When she arrives there she simply keeps walking, though in our model we see her leave the “screen” and reappear at the antipodal point \(c_a\text{.}\)  She has her sights set on point \(d\) and saunters down there, continues on (reappearing at \(d_a\)), and heads on to \(q\text{,}\) hungry but content.</p>
