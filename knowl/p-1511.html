<p>In this way, we can transfer the geometry of the 3-sphere into real 3-space with a point at infinity attached to it. For instance, if \(P = (a,b,c,d)\) is on the 3-sphere, its antipodal point is \(-P = (-a,-b,-c,-d)\) and one can show (in the exercises) that these points get mapped by \(\phi\) to points in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) (pure quaternions) \(q = \phi(P)\) and \(u = \phi(-P)\) with the property that \(q \cdot u^* = -1\text{.}\) As a result, two points \(q\) and \(u\) in \(\widehat{\mathbb{R}^3}\) are called antipodal points if they satisfy the equation \(q \cdot u^* = -1\text{.}\)</p>
