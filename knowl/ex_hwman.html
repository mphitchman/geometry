</h6>
<p> This interesting manifold can be constructed from two identically sized cubes that share a face, as in the following figure. The resulting box has 10 faces to be identified in pairs. A three-dimensional bug with a jet pack living in the manifold would experience the following face identifications. The top and bottom faces are identified just as they were in the 3-torus. Each point on the top back face (see the circle in the figure) is identified with a single point on the bottom back face. This point is the reflection of the given point across the vertical segment bisecting the face. The top front face and the bottom front face are identified the same way. The figure shows two square points on these faces that are identified. The top left face and bottom right face are identified with a 180\(^\circ\) rotation (see the elliptical point and its image point), as are the bottom left face and the top right face (the two triangular points are identified). This 3-manifold also inherits Euclidean geometry.</p>
