<p>We may think of the 3-torus \(\mathbb{T}^3\) as a cubical room with the following face (or wall) identifications: if we propel ourselves (with a jet pack) up through the ceiling, we reappear through the floor directly below where we had been. For instance, the elliptical points in the following figure are identified. Each point on the top face is identified with the corresponding point on the bottom face. If we fly through the left wall we reappear through the right wall at the corresponding spot (see the triangles in the figure). If we fly through the front wall we reappear through the back wall at the corresponding spot (see the squares in the figure).</p>
