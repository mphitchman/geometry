<p>Simply put, hyperbolic squares don't exist. In fact, no four-sided figures with four right angles exist, <em class="emphasis">if we assume the sides are hyperbolic segments</em>. If such a figure existed, its angle sum would be 2\(\pi\text{.}\) But such a figure could be divided along a diagonal into two triangles whose total angle sum must then be \(2\pi\) as well. This means that one of the triangles would have angle sum at least \(\pi\text{,}\) which cannot happen.</p>
