<p>This construction gives us a right angled hexagon such that \(d_H(v_0,v_1) = a\) and \(d_H(v_2,v_3) = b\text{.}\) We also want \(d_H(v_4,v_5) =
c\text{.}\) Notice that this last distance is a function of the position of vertex \(v_2\) on line A. As \(v_2\) goes along \(A\) to \(v_1\) there is a point beyond which \(D\) no longer exists, and as \(v_2\) goes along \(A\) to the circle at infinity, the length of segment \(v_4v_5\) takes on all positive real values. So, by the intermediate value theorem, there is some point at which the segment has length \(c\text{.}\) Finally, all right-angled hexagons with alternate side lengths \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) and \(c\) are congruent to the one just constructed because angles, hyperbolic lines, and distances are preserved under transformations in \({\cal H}\text{.}\)</p>
