<p>In short, the universe appears to be homogeneous, isotropic, nearly flat, and dominated by dark energy. The current estimates for \(\Omega_k\) leave the question of the geometry of the universe open, though just barely. It is still possible that our universe is a hyperbolic or an elliptic manifold, but the curvature would have to be very close to 0. If the universe is a compact, orientable Euclidean manifold, we have six different possibilities for its shape. Since Euclidean manifold volumes aren't fixed by curvature, there is no reason to expect the dimensions of a Euclidean manifold to be close to the radius of the observable universe. But if the size is right, the circles-in-the-sky method would reveal the shape of the universe through matching circles.</p>
