<p>One could let the space be all of \(\mathbb{C}^+\text{.}\) If we take this tack, then we are reproducing the geometry of the sphere in \(\mathbb{C}^+\text{.}\) We call the geometry \((\mathbb{C}^+,{\cal S})\) <dfn class="terminology">spherical geometry</dfn>.  Distance can be defined to match distance on the unit sphere, and great cirlces in \(\mathbb{C}^+\) will be geodesics.  Rather than develop these details with this choice of spaces, we will focus instead on a different space.  We do so because we want to build a geometry in which there is a <em class="emphasis">unique</em> line between any two points. This is not quite true on the sphere, and so not quite true in \((\mathbb{C}^+,{\cal S})\text{.}\)  If two points in \(\mathbb{C}^+\) are antipodal points, such as 0 and \(\infty\text{,}\) then there are infinitely many lines (great circles) through these points.</p>
