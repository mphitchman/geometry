<p>The other type of recurring distance can arise from what's been called a Type I pair of points in the catalog. A Type I pair consists of any pair \(\{p,q\}\) of points. If we can see images of these points in a copy of the fundamental domain, say \({T(p),T(q)}\text{,}\) then since transformations preserve distance, \(d(p,q) = d(T(p),T(q))\text{,}\) and this common distance will have occurred at least twice in the PSH. The figure below shows a portion of the torus tiling of the plane depicted in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-detectim.html" title="Figure 8.2.2">FigureÂ 8.2.2</a>. The two types of pairs of points are visible: Type I pairs are joined by dashed segments, and Type II pairs are joined by solid segments.</p>
