<p><a knowl="./knowl/fig-moveM.html" title="Figure 5.1.7">Figure 5.1.7</a>(a) depicts the image of the figure \(M\) (resembling the letter ‘M’) under two applications of a rotation \(T\) of the hyperbolic plane about point \(p\text{.}\) This rotation is generated by two inversions about clines \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) that intersect at \(p\) (and meet \(\mathbb{S}^1_\infty\) at right angles). The figure \(M\) is pictured, as is \(T(M)\) and \(T(T(M))\text{.}\) The figure also tracks successive images of a point \(z\) on \(M\text{:}\) \(z\) gets mapped to \(T(z)\) which gets mapped to \(T^2(z) = T(T(z))\text{.}\) By this map \(T\text{,}\) any point \(z\) in \(\mathbb{D}\) rotates around \(p\) along the unique type II cline of \(p\) and \(p^*\) that contains \(z\text{.}\)</p>
<p><a knowl="./knowl/fig-moveM.html" title="Figure 5.1.7">Figure 5.1.7</a>(b) depicts the image of \(M\) under two applications of a translation of the hyperbolic plane. The translation is generated by two inversions about non-intersecting clines \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) (that meet \(\mathbb{S}^1_\infty\) at right angles). The fixed points of the map are the points \(p\) and \(q\) on the circle at infinity. Under this translation, any point \(z\) in \(\mathbb{D}\) heads away from \(p\) and toward \(q\) on the unique cline through the three points \(p,q,\) and \(z\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section5-1.html#example-39">in-context</a></span>
