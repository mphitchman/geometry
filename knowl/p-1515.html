<p>Hyperbolic 3-manifolds have not been completely classified, but a remarkable relationship exists between geometry and shape in this case: a connected orientable 3-manifold supports at most one hyperbolic structure. This marks an important difference from the two-dimensional case. If a two-dimensional being knows that she lives in a two-holed torus, say, then the area of her universe is determined by its curvature, thanks to the Gauss-Bonnet formula, but other geometric properties may vary, such as the length of minimal-length closed geodesic paths in the universe, as we saw in <a knowl="./knowl/ex_pants.html" title="Example 7.6.6: Building hyperbolic surfaces from pants">ExampleÂ 7.6.6</a>. No such freedom exists in the three-dimensional case.</p>
