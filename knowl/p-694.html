<p>It turns out that these reflections generate all the maps in \({\cal H}\text{.}\) For instance, rotation about the origin is a MÃ¶bius transformation that sends \(\mathbb{D}\) to itself, so it is in \(\cal H\text{.}\) But rotation about the origin is also the composition of two reflections about lines that intersect at the origin. Since any line through the origin meets the unit circle at right angles, reflection about such a line is a reflection of the hyperbolic plane, so rotation about the origin is the composition of two such reflections. We now prove the following general result.</p>
