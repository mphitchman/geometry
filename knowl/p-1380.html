<p>The attempt (d) fails to be a cell division of the torus. Why is this? At first glance, we have four vertices, four edges, and two faces. The trouble here is the “face” outside the inner square. It is not a 2-cell - that is, its interior is not homeomorphic to an open 2-ball. To see this, note that this region contains a loop that does not separate the “face” into two pieces. Can you find such a loop? Since no open 2-ball has this feature, the region in question is not homeomorphic to an open 2-ball.</p>
