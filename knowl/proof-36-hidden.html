<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>We prove the existence of a right-angled hexagon with vertices \(v_0, v_1,
\cdots, v_5\) such that \(d_H(v_0,v_1) = a, d_H(v_2,v_3) = b\text{,}\) and \(d_H(v_4,v_5) = c\text{.}\)</p>
<figure class="figure-like"><img src="images/im-righthexagon.svg" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span> <span class="codenumber">5.4.20</span> Building a right hexagon in the hyperbolic plane that has alternate side lengths \((a,b,c)\text{.}\)</figcaption></figure><p>First, let \(v_0\) be the origin in the hyperbolic plane, and place \(v_1\) on the positive real axis so that \(d_H(v_0,v_1)= a\text{.}\)  Note that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
v_1 = \frac{e^a - 1}{e^a+1}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Next, construct the hyperbolic line \(A\) perpendicular to the real axis at the point \(v_1\text{.}\) This line is part of the cline that has diameter \(v_1v_1^*\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Pick any point \(v_2\) on the line \(A\text{.}\) For the sake of argument, assume that \(v_2\) lies above the real axis, as in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-righthexagon.html" title="Figure 5.4.20">FigureÂ 5.4.20</a>.</p>
<p>Next, construct the hyperbolic line \(B\) perpendicular to \(A\) at the point \(v_2\text{.}\) This line is part of the cline through \(v_2\) and \(v_2^*\) with center on the line tangent to \(A\) at \(v_2\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Next, construct the point \(v_3\) on line \(B\) that is a distance \(b\) away from \(v_2\text{.}\) This point is found by intersecting \(B\) with the hyperbolic circle centered at \(v_2\) with radius \(b\text{.}\) (To construct this circle, we first find the scalar \(k\) so that the hyperbolic distance between \(kv_2\) and \(v_2\) is \(b\text{.}\))</p>
<p>Next, draw the perpendicular \(C\) to line \(B\) at \(v_3\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Then construct the common perpendicular of \(C\) and the imaginary axis, call this perpendicular \(D\text{.}\) We construct this common perpendicular as follows. First find the two points \(p\) and \(q\) symmetric to both \(C\) and the imaginary axis. Then find \(p^*\text{,}\) the point symmetric to \(p\) with respect to \(\mathbb{S}^1_\infty\text{.}\) The cline through \(p\text{,}\) \(q\text{,}\) and \(p^*\) is perpendicular to \(C\text{,}\) the imaginary axis and \(\mathbb{S}^1_\infty\text{,}\) so this gives us our line \(D\text{.}\)</p>
<p>If \(C\) and the imaginary axis intersect, no such perpendicular exists (think triangle angles), so drag \(v_2\) toward \(v_1\) until these lines do not intersect. Then construct \(D\) as in the preceeding paragraph. Let \(v_4\) and \(v_5\) be the points of intersection of \(D\) with \(C\) and the imaginary axis, respectively.</p>
<p>This construction gives us a right angled hexagon such that \(d_H(v_0,v_1) = a\) and \(d_H(v_2,v_3) = b\text{.}\) We also want \(d_H(v_4,v_5) =
c\text{.}\) Notice that this last distance is a function of the position of vertex \(v_2\) on line A. As \(v_2\) goes along \(A\) to \(v_1\) there is a point beyond which \(D\) no longer exists, and as \(v_2\) goes along \(A\) to the circle at infinity, the length of segment \(v_4v_5\) takes on all positive real values. So, by the intermediate value theorem, there is some point at which the segment has length \(c\text{.}\) Finally, all right-angled hexagons with alternate side lengths \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) and \(c\) are congruent to the one just constructed because angles, hyperbolic lines, and distances are preserved under transformations in \({\cal H}\text{.}\)</p></article></body>
