</h5>
<p>Suppose a two-dimensional ship is plopped down in \(\mathbb{D}\text{.}\) What would the pilot see? How would the ship move? How would the pilot describe the world? Are all points equivalent in this world? Could the pilot figure out whether the universe adheres to hyperbolic geometry as opposed to, say, Euclidean geometry?</p>
<p>Recall what we know about hyperbolic geometry. First of all, any two points in the hyperbolic plane are congruent, so the geometry <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> homogeneous. The pilot could not distinguish between any two points.</p>
<p>Second, the shortest path between two points is the hyperbolic line between them, so light would travel along these hyperbolic lines (assuming light follows geodesics). The pilot's line of sight would follow along these lines, and the ship would move along these lines to fly as quickly as possible from \(p\) to \(q\) (assuming no pesty asteroid fields block the path). So, for instance, to observe a galaxy at point \(q\) in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-2hyptri.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-2hyptri" alt="Figure 5.4.18 " title="Figure 5.4.18 ">FigureÂ 18</a> from the point \(p\text{,}\) the pilot would point a telescope in the direction of line \(L\text{,}\) the line along which the light from the galaxy travels to reach the telescope.</p>
<p>With a well-defined metric, we can say more. The pilot will view the hyperbolic plane as infinite and without boundary. In theory, the pilot can make a circular orbit of arbitrary radius about an asteroid located anywhere in the space.</p>
<p>To test for hyperbolic geometry, perhaps the pilot can turn to triangles. The angles of a triangle in the hyperbolic plane sum to less than 180\(^\circ\text{,}\) but only noticeably so for large enough triangles.  In our disk model of hyperbolic geometry, we can easily observe this angle deficiency.  In the figure below, triangle \(\Delta zuw\) has angle sum about \(130^\circ\text{,}\) and \(\Delta pqr\) has angle sum of about \(22^\circ\text{!}\)  Whether an intrepid 2-D explorer could map out such a large triangle depends on how much ground she could cover relative to the size of her universe.  We will have more to say about such things in Chapters 7 and 8.</p>
