<li>The circle centered at 0 with elliptic radius \(\pi/2\) is in fact an elliptic straight line, as represented by the heavy line in part (a) of the following diagram.</li>
<li>The circle centered at 0 with elliptic radius \(2\pi/3\) has Euclidean radius \(r = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\text{.}\) Suppose a bug starts at the origin and travels west, say, along the dashed path in part (b) of the following diagram.  At an elliptic distance of \(\pi/2\) the bug finds that it crosses through the boundary disk at -1 and reappears at 1, and continues to walk another \(\pi/6\) units to make a total journey of length \(\pi/2 + \pi/6 = 2\pi/3\) units. The journey leaves the bug on the positive real axis at an elliptic distance of \(\pi/2 - \pi/6 = \pi/3\) from the origin.  The \(x\)-coordinate of this point is found by noting that \(d_S(0,x)=\pi/3\) with \(0 \lt x \lt 1\) when \(\pi/3 = 2\arctan(x)\text{.}\) That is, \(x = \tan(\pi/6) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\text{.}\)  A bug at the origin might have the impression of being surrounded by the “outside” of the circle.</li>
<li>In this case, the circle is a single point: the origin is the only point in \(\mathbb{P}^2\) an elliptic distance \(\pi\) from the origin.</li>
<li>Again, the circle is a single point, the origin.</li>
