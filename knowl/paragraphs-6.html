<p>If we think of \(\infty\) as just another point in \(\mathbb{C}^+\text{,}\) it makes sense to ask about angles at this point. For instance, any two lines intersect at \(\infty\text{,}\) and it makes sense to ask about the angle of intersection at \(\infty\text{.}\) We can be guided in answering this question by stereographic projection, thanks to the following theorem.</p>

<p>Stereographic projection preserves angles. That is, if two curves on the surface of the sphere intersect at angle \(\theta\text{,}\) then their image curves in \(\mathbb{C}^+\) also intersect at angle \(\theta\text{.}\)</p></article><p>Thus, if two curves in \(\mathbb{C}^+\) intersect at \(\infty\) we may define the angle at which they intersect to equal the angle at which their pre-image curves under stereographic projection intersect. The angle at which two parallel lines intersect at \(\infty\) is 0. Furthermore, if two lines intersect at a finite point \(p\) as well as at \(\infty\text{,}\) the angle at which they intersect at \(\infty\) equals the negative of the angle at which they intersect at \(p\text{.}\) As a consequence, we may say that inversion about a circle preserves angle magnitudes at all points in \(\mathbb{C}^+\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section3-3.html#paragraphs-6">in-context</a></span>
