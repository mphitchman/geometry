<p>If the surface is built from a single polygon, the edge identifications of the polygon can be encoded in a <dfn class="terminology">boundary label</dfn>. Each edge of the polygon gets assigned a letter and an orientation. Edges that are identified have the same letter, and we obtain a boundary label by traversing the boundary of our polygon in the counter-clockwise direction (by convention) and recording the letters we encounter, with an exponent of +1 if our walk is in the direction of the oriented edge, and an exponent of -1 if our walk is in the opposite direction of the oriented edge. For instance, a boundary label for the surface \(C_2\) found in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-C2.html" title="Figure 7.5.11">Figure 7.5.11</a> is \(a_1a_1a_2a_2\text{.}\) Furthermore, we may inductively show that by repeating the connected sum operation of <a knowl="./knowl/fig-C2.html" title="Figure 7.5.11">Figure 7.5.11</a> to \(C_{g-1}\#C_1\text{,}\) the surface \(C_g\) can be represented as a \(2g\)-gon having boundary label</p>
