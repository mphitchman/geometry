<p>Let \(\mathbb{T}^2\) denote the torus surface in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) and \(\mathbb{S}^2\) denote the sphere, as usual. <a knowl="./knowl/fig-connsum.html" title="Figure 7.5.8">Figure 7.5.8</a> depicts two connected sums: \(\mathbb{T}^2 \# \mathbb{T}^2\text{,}\) and \(\mathbb{S}^2 \# \mathbb{T}^2\text{.}\)   The surface \(\mathbb{T}^2 \# \mathbb{T}^2\) is called the two-holed torus, and it is topologically equivalent to the surface labeled \(H_2\) in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-handlebodies.html" title="Figure 7.5.10">Figure 7.5.10</a>.  One can shrink the length dimension of the connecting cylinder to make the one look like the other.  The surface \(\mathbb{S}^2 \# \mathbb{T}^2\) is homeomorphic to the torus \(\mathbb{T}^2\text{.}\) To see this, observe that if one removes an open-2 ball from a sphere and attaches one end of a cylinder to the sphere along the boundary of the removed disk, the result is homeomorphic to a closed disk, as suggested in the following diagram. So, if one removes an open 2-ball from a surface \(X\) and then caps the hole with this sphere-with-cylinder shape, the net effect is patching the hole. In the arithmetic of connected sums, the sphere plays the role of \(0\text{:}\) \(\mathbb{S}^2 \# X = X\) for any surface \(X\text{.}\)</p>
