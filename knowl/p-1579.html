<p>Immediately after the big bang, the universe was so hot that the usual constituents of matter could not form. Photons could not move freely in space, as they were constantly bumping into free electrons. Eventually, about 350,000 years after the big bang, the universe had expanded and cooled to the point that light could travel unimpeded. This free radiation is called the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and much of it is still travelling today. The universe has cooled and expanded to the point that this radiation has stretched to the microwave end of the electromagnetic spectrum, having a wavelength of about 1 or 2 millimeters.</p>
