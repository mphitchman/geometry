## Geometry with an Introduction to Cosmic Topology

Motivated by questions in cosmology, the open-content text *Geometry with an Introduction to Cosmic Topology* (GCT) uses MÃ¶bius transformations to develop hyperbolic, elliptic, and Euclidean geometries - three possibilities for the global geometry of the universe.

This repository hosts the [website](https://mphitchman.com) for the text, the companion guide to the text, as well as print and screen pdfs of the text.
