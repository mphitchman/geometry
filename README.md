## Geometry with an Introduction to Cosmic Topology

Motivated by questions in cosmology, the open-content text **Geometry with an Introduction to Cosmic Topology** (GCT) uses MÃ¶bius transformations to develop hyperbolic, elliptic, and Euclidean geometries - three possibilities for the global geometry of the universe.

This repository hosts the website for the text, the companion guide to the text, as well as print and screen pdfs of the text.
