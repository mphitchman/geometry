## Geometry with an Introduction to Cosmic Topology

Motivated by questions in cosmology, the open-content text *Geometry with an Introduction to Cosmic Topology* (GCT) uses MÃ¶bius transformations to develop hyperbolic, elliptic, and Euclidean geometries - three possibilities for the global geometry of the universe.

This repository contains the text in all its output forms: html, screen pdf, and print pdf (all three forms generated with PreTeXt). The text can be easily read and downloaded at the text [website](https://mphitchman.com). The *companion guide* to the text is housed in the Github repository [`gctguide`](https://github.com/mphitchman/gctguide).
