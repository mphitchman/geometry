<a href="section7-5.html" class="permalink">¶</a><section class="introduction" id="introduction-34"><p id="p-1317">Back in Chapter 1 we motivated the study of non-Euclidean geometry with a question in cosmology: What is the shape of the universe? We discussed the idea that different shapes inherit different types of geometry. Indeed, the rules of geometry are different on a sphere than on a flat plane. In this section we take a break from geometry in order to discuss the shapes themselves.</p>
<p id="p-1318">In topology one studies those features of a space that remain unchanged if the space is stretched or otherwise continuously deformed. Such features of a space are called topological features.</p>
<p id="p-1319">The features of a space that <em class="emphasis">do</em> change under such deformations are geometric features. For instance, as a ball is inflated its volume, curvature, and surface area change; these are geometric properties. On the other hand, no matter how big or lumpy the ball gets, or how it is stretched (unless it pops!), a loop drawn on the surface of the ball separates the surface into two disjoint pieces. This is a topological property of the ball. A second topological property of a space is whether any loop drawn on it can be continuously contracted (while staying in the space) to a point. The sphere also has this feature. Nothing about the sphere's shape prevents a loop from shrinking on the surface to a point.</p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="fig-cutsets"><img src="images/im-cutsets.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span> <span class="codenumber">7.5.1</span> The sphere and torus are topologically distinct.</figcaption></figure><p id="p-1320">On the surface of a donut there are loops one can draw that do <em class="emphasis">not</em> separate the surface into disjoint pieces. The loop that goes around the donut like an armband in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-cutsets.html" title="Figure 7.5.1">Figure 7.5.1</a> is one such loop. Furthermore, this loop cannot be continuously contracted to a point while staying on the surface. This suggests the surface of a ball and the surface of a donut are topologically different shapes.</p>
<p id="p-1321">The sphere is an example of a <dfn class="terminology">simply connected space</dfn> because any loop drawn on the surface can be contracted to a point. The torus is an example of a <dfn class="terminology">multiconnected space</dfn> because there exist loops in the torus that cannot be contracted to a point.</p>
<p id="p-1322">Roughly speaking, two spaces are topologically equivalent, or <dfn class="terminology">homeomorphic</dfn>, if one can be continuously deformed to look like the other. For instance, a circle is topologically equivalent to a square. One can be mapped onto the other via a <dfn class="terminology">homeomorphism</dfn>: a continuous bijection between the objects that has a continuous inverse. One homeomorphism is suggested in the following example.</p>
<article class="example-like" id="example-61"><h6 class="heading">
<span class="type">Example</span> <span class="codenumber">7.5.2</span> <span class="title">A circle is homeomorphic to a square</span>
</h6>
<p id="p-1323">Construct a homeomorphism as follows. Assume the square and circle are concentric as shown below, and that \(z_0\) is the center of the circle. Then, for each point \(z\) on the square, define \(T(z)\) to be the point on the circle through which the ray \(\overrightarrow{z_0z}\) passes. One can show that \(T\) is a homeomorphism: it is a 1-1 and onto function that is continuous, and its inverse is continuous as well.</p>

In this text we restrict our focus to a whirlwind tour of topological tools that are used to investigate possible shapes for two- and three-dimensional universes.  We encourage the reader interested in a more formal approach to the subject to consult any number of good texts, including <a knowl="./knowl/sieradski.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 9: An Introduction to Topology and Homotopy">[9]</a>.</p>
<p id="p-1325">Our candidate universes are examples of manifolds. A topological \(n\)-manifold is a space with the feature that each point in the space has a neighborhood that looks like a patch of \(\mathbb{R}^n\text{.}\) In cosmology, the spatial section of space-time is assumed to be a 3-manifold, and when we ask about the shape of the universe, we are asking about the shape of this 3-manifold. In this section we focus on 2-manifolds.</p>
<p id="p-1326">A bit more formally, \(\mathbb{R}^n\)  consists of all \(n\)-tuples of real numbers \(\boldsymbol{p} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\text{.}\)  The <dfn class="terminology">open \(n\)-ball</dfn> centered at a point \(\boldsymbol{p}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) with radius \(r \gt 0\text{,}\) denoted \(B_n(\boldsymbol{p},r)\text{,}\) is the set</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
B_n(\boldsymbol{p},r) = \{\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n~|~ |\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{p}| \lt  r \}, 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(|\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{p}|\) is the Euclidean distance between the points \(\boldsymbol{x}\) and \(\boldsymbol{p}\text{.}\)</p>
<p id="p-1327">For instance, an open 1-ball is an open interval in \(\mathbb{R}\text{.}\)  The open 2-ball \(B_2(z_0,r)\) consists of all points \(z\) in \(\mathbb{C}\) such that \(|z - z_0| \lt  r\text{.}\) The open 3-ball \(B_3(\boldsymbol{p},r)\) consists of all points in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) inside the sphere centered at \(\boldsymbol{p}\) with radius \(r\text{.}\)</p>

<p id="p-1330">a. Let \(S\) consist of parallel planes in \(\mathbb{R}^3.\) In particular, let \(S = \{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 ~|~ z = 0~\text{or}~z=1\}\) as in part (a) of the following diagram. Each point in \(S\) has a neighborhood of points that is an open 2-ball.</p>

<p id="p-1331">b. The open unit disk \(\mathbb{D} = \{z \in \mathbb{C} ~|~ |z| \lt 1\}\) is a 2-manifold. Each point in \(\mathbb{D}\) has a neighborhood that is an open 2-ball in the plane. In particular, if \(|z| = r \lt  1\text{,}\) let \(s = 1-r\text{.}\) Then \(B_2(z,s)\) does the trick.</p>
<p id="p-1332">c. <em class="emphasis">The flat torus.</em> Consider the flat torus of chapter 1, which has been redrawn in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-t2man.html" title="Figure 7.5.5">Figure 7.5.5</a>. It consists of all points in a rectangle drawn in the Euclidean plane, with the additional feature that each point on the top edge is identified with the point on the bottom edge having the same \(x\)-coordinate; and each point on the left edge is identified with the point on the right edge having the same \(y\)-coordinate.  In <a knowl="./knowl/fig-t2man.html" title="Figure 7.5.5">Figure 7.5.5</a> we indicate this edge identification with oriented labels: the \(a\) edges get identified by matching the arrow orientations, as do the \(b\) edges.</p>
<p id="p-1333">Each point in the flat torus has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open 2-ball.</p>
<p id="p-1334">If a point \(p\) is not on an edge, as in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-t2man.html" title="Figure 7.5.5">Figure 7.5.5</a>, then by choosing a radius small enough, there is an open 2-ball about the point that misses the edges.</p>
<p id="p-1335">If a point \(q\) is on an edge but not at a corner, then by choosing a radius small enough, there is an open 2-ball about the point that misses the corners. This open 2-ball consists of parts of two open 2-balls from \(\mathbb{R}^2\text{.}\) Because of the edge identification, these open 2-ball halves come together to form a perfect open 2-ball about the point.</p>
<p id="p-1336">If a point \(u\) is at a corner of the rectangle, there is an open 2-ball about the point that consists of parts of four different open 2-balls from \(\mathbb{R}^2\text{.}\) Because of the edge identification, these four “quarter balls” come together to form a single open 2-ball of points around the corner point.</p></article><figure class="figure-like" id="fig-t2man"><img src="images/im-t2man.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span> <span class="codenumber">7.5.5</span> The flat torus is a 2-manifold as well as a surface</figcaption></figure><article class="definition-like" id="definition-35"><h6 class="heading">
<span class="type">Definition</span> <span class="codenumber">7.5.6</span>
</h6>
<p id="p-1337">A <dfn class="terminology">surface</dfn> is a closed, bounded, and connected topological 2-manifold.</p></article><p id="p-1338">Of the 2-manifolds in <a knowl="./knowl/example-2manifolds.html" title="Example 7.5.4: Some 2-manifolds">Example 7.5.4</a>, only the third is a surface according to this definition. A set in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is <dfn class="terminology">bounded</dfn> if it lives entirely within some open \(n\)-ball of finite radius. The parallel planes manifold extends infinitely far away from the origin in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) so this manifold is not bounded. This manifold is not connected either.  Informally, a space is connected if it has just one piece. The parallel planes manifold has two distinct pieces (the two planes) that are separated in space, so it is not connected. The open unit disk \(\mathbb{D}\) is bounded and connected, but not closed as a set in \(\mathbb{R}^2\text{.}\) A set \(S\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is <dfn class="terminology">closed</dfn> if it has the following feature: if \(\{z_k\}\) is a sequence of points in \(S\) that converges to a point \(z\text{,}\) then \(z\) is also in \(S\text{.}\)</p>
<p id="p-1339">To see that \(\mathbb{D}\) is not closed, consider the sequence \(\{\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5},\ldots \}\text{.}\)  Each point in this sequence lives in \(\mathbb{D}\text{,}\) but the limit of the sequence, which is 1, does not.  The torus, on the other hand, is closed, boundede, and connected, so we call it a surface.  We note that another topological term, compactness, is often used when discussing surfaces. A space living in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is <em class="emphasis">compact</em> if and only if it is closed and bounded. Thus, for us, a surface is a compact, connected 2-manifold.</p>
<p id="p-1340">Rather than concern ourselves with a formal development of these topological concepts, we take with us this informal introduction to help us to pursue the construction of surfaces. It turns out that all surfaces can be built from the three venerable surfaces in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-vensurfaces.html" title="Figure 7.5.7">Figure 7.5.7</a> by a process called the connected sum.</p>

<p id="p-1341">If \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) are surfaces, the <dfn class="terminology">connected sum</dfn> surface, denoted \(X_1 \#
X_2\text{,}\) is obtained as follows: </p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-58">Remove an open 2-ball from \(X_1\) and an open 2-ball from \(X_2\text{;}\)</li>
<li id="li-59">Connect the boundaries of these open 2-ball with a cylinder.</li>
</ol>
<p id="p-1342">Note that since \(X_i\) is a surface, each point in each space has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open 2-ball, so we may always achieve the connected sum of two surfaces. The result is a new surface: it is still closed, bounded, and connected, and each point still has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open 2-ball.</p></article><figure class="figure-like" id="fig-connsum"><img src="images/im-connsum.svg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span> <span class="codenumber">7.5.8</span> Some connected sums.</figcaption></figure><article class="example-like" id="example-63"><h6 class="heading">

To build a polygonal surface, start with a finite number of polygons having an even number of edges and then identify edges in pairs.</p>
<p id="p-1350">If the surface is built from a single polygon, the edge identifications of the polygon can be encoded in a <dfn class="terminology">boundary label</dfn>. Each edge of the polygon gets assigned a letter and an orientation. Edges that are identified have the same letter, and we obtain a boundary label by traversing the boundary of our polygon in the counter-clockwise direction (by convention) and recording the letters we encounter, with an exponent of +1 if our walk is in the direction of the oriented edge, and an exponent of -1 if our walk is in the opposite direction of the oriented edge. For instance, a boundary label for the surface \(C_2\) found in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-C2.html" title="Figure 7.5.11">Figure 7.5.11</a> is \(a_1a_1a_2a_2\text{.}\) Furthermore, we may inductively show that by repeating the connected sum operation of <a knowl="./knowl/fig-C2.html" title="Figure 7.5.11">Figure 7.5.11</a> to \(C_{g-1}\#C_1\text{,}\) the surface \(C_g\) can be represented as a \(2g\)-gon having boundary label</p>

The classic proof, which makes use of cell divisions, can be found, for instance, in <a knowl="./knowl/sieradski.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 9: An Introduction to Topology and Homotopy">[9]</a>. The new proof, due to John Conway, bypasses the artificial constructs in the classic proof, and can be found in <a knowl="./knowl/weeks.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 12: The Shape of Space, 2nd Ed.">[12]</a>.</p>
<p id="p-1355">To summarize, we have two ways to think about surfaces. First, the classification theorem above can be restated as follows: any surface is homeomorphic to the sphere, the sphere with some number of handles attached, or the sphere with some number of cross-caps attached. Second, any surface can be constructed from a 2m-gon with its edges identified in pairs, for some \(m \geq 1\text{.}\)</p>

At the top of <a knowl="./knowl/fig-c2isklein.html" title="Figure 7.5.27">Figure 7.5.27</a> there are two projective planes (with boundary labels \(a_1a_1\) and \(a_2a_2\)), each with a disk removed. In the connected sum, join the boundaries of the removed disks, which can be achieved by joining the \(s_1\) arcs together and the \(s_2\) arcs together. The \(b\) and \(c\) edges in the first projective plane (and the \(d\) and \(e\) edges in the second projective plane) indicate cuts we will make to the space, portrayed in the subsequent pictures. Thus, by removing a disk from each projective plane, and cutting as indicated by the \(b, c, d\text{,}\) and \(e\) edges, we obtain four rectangles (topologically), all of whose edges get identified as indicated. Convince yourself that by moving these rectangles around (either by rotation, or reflection about a vertical or horizontal axis) we produce the Klein bottle.</p></article><article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-192"><h6 class="heading">
